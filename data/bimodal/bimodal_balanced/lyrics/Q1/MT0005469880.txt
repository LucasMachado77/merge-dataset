Well, I met a girl from Texas 'bout a year ago
Hadn't known her for too long when I had to let her go
You see, she had a razor, was ten inches or so
And every night you'd hear her knocking at my door
She said, "Baby, I'll give you the clothes off my back
You can have everything that I've got in my shack
But if you ever try to leave they'll take you out in sack
'Cause me and my razor will see to that"

That's the way the girls are from Texas
That's the way the girls are from Texas
That's the way the girls are from Texas

I thought about my situation, decided not to tarry
For my own self preservation I decided we should marry
When the preacher started reading 'bout 'till death do us part
I told him, "Skip it, she had that understanding right from the start"
She said, "Baby, I'll give you the clothes off my back
You can have everything that I've got in my shack
But if you ever try to leave they'll take you out in sack
'Cause me and my razor will see to that"

That's the way the girls are from Texas (Houston to San Antone)
That's the way the girls are from Texas (Got to love 'em right or leave 'em alone)
That's the way the girls are from Texas
Yeah that's the way the girls are from Texas

Well, we settled down, got me a little old job, '65 Fairlane Ford
Every Friday night I would stop in and cash my pay check down at the grocery store
They had a little girl worked in there, must have been about seventeen
She was the cutest thing I had ever seen
It's the same old story and I'm afraid it wasn't too very long
Before we had fallen deeply in love and I knew it was wrong
So I said baby, we got to stop this thing right here
Or my woman is gonna cut my throat from ear to ear
That's right
In tearful supplication, she looked up in my face
I could feel her heart was breaking as these sad words she did say
"You should have told me you was married, baby"
As she pulled out a forty-five and let me have it, right smack between the eyes

That's the way the girls are from Texas
That's the way the girls are from Texas
That's the way the girls are from Texas

She was guilty, I was dead! (That's the way the girls are from Texas)
Now, what'd you think that the old judge said? (That's the way the girls are from Texas)
"Ah, that's just the way the girls are down here in Texas
Case dismissed!"
That's the way the girls are from Texas (Houston to San Antone)
That's the way the girls are from Texas (Love 'em right or leave 'em alone, boy)
That's the way the girls are from Texas
That's the way the girls are from Texas
