I would climb any mountain
And sail across the stormy sea
If that's what it takes baby
To show how much you mean to me
I guess it's just the man in you
That brings out the woman in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me

Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time

Waited a lifetime and
Spent my time so foolishly
But now that I've found you
Together we'll make history yeah
I know it must be the man in you
That brings out the woman in me
Oh, I can't help myself
You're all that my eyes can see

It feels like the first time
Like it never did before
It feels like the first time
Like we've opened up the door
It feels like the first time
Like it never will again
Never, never, never, never, never again

Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time

Ooh, the first time
Ooh, the first time
Hey, did you remember
The very first time

Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time

Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
Feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time

Feel I felt the first time
Did it feel?
The second time is like the first time
The third time was like the first time
Every other time is just like the first time.
