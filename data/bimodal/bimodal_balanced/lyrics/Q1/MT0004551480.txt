Listen Mr. Khrushchev, I heard a lot of talk
Satellite and missiles and Eisenhower's fault
But now you better listen to what I got to say
The thing I'm gonna tell you, man, it'll make your hair turn gray

I got a satellite baby with a red hot style that's new
Yea, I got a satellite baby that can rock it all night through
She can make more speed than Sputnik No. 2

Now you talk about the Sputnik and your hound dog crew
I got a rocket, baby, faster than the Asiatic flu

I got a satellite baby with a red hot style that's new
She can make more speed than Sputnik No. 2

Yes, I got a hot rocket baby, can leave you any time
Yes, I got a hot rocket baby will leave you flyin' blind
When she gets in gear you'll think it's the end of time
Now you talk about the Sputnik and your hound dog crew
I got a rocket, baby, faster than the Asiatic flu
I got a satellite, baby, with a style that's new
She can make more speed than Sputnik No. 2
