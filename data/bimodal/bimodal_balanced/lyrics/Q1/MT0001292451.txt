It's always fair weather
When hepcats get together
And every time they meet
Here's the way you'll hear them greet
(Reet)

A hubba-hubba-hubba, hello Dad
Well a hubba-hubba-hubba, I just got back
Well a hubba-hubba-hubba, let's shoot some breeze
Say, whatever happened to the Japanese?

Hmm, a hubba-hubba-hubba, haven't you heard?
A hubba-hubba-hubba, slip me the word
I got it from a guy who was in the know
It was mighty smoky over Tokyo
A friend of mine in a B-29 dropped another load for luck
As he flew away, he was heard to say
"A hubba-hubba-hubba, yuk yuk"

Well I gotta go fishin'
That's okay
We'll give you our permission
And we'll say
A hubba-hubba-hubba, on your way
And I will dig you later in the USA
Ta la la dee dee dee dee dee dee dee da, oh hi hi hi do do do, hmm

A hubba-hubba-hubba, I just got in
A hubba-hubba-hubba, well give me some skin
Well you're lookin' mighty purdy, Miss Curly Locks
I'm the Gravel Gertie of the bobby socks

Hmm a yuttata-yuttata-yuttata, a-you talk big
Well I'm the fresh tomata you can't dig
Let's have a heart to hearta and you'll decide
I'm a chick what's really on the solid side

You knock me flat, you're the kind of a cat
Makes me wanna blow my top
'Til the end of time
Ahh!
And if you feel that way, tell me what you say?
A hubba-hubba-hubba muk muk

Well now you're really talkin'
You're no square
You can't be from Weehawken
Mm-mm, Delaware

You got a line of jive that's really zoo
Well I'll dig you later baby you're all root
Ta ta da da da da da da

You're the kind of cat, wears a sharp cravat
And you really know your stuff
If you feel that way, tell me what you say?
Hubba-hubba-hubba ruff ruff

I get along a little mousy with the great big eyes
Well if you're lookin' for a spousey
Why, you're just my size

Mister how you love to blubber
With that knock out squawk
Seems your lips are made of rubber
Every time you talk
Oh no, no, no, hubba-hubba
Yes, yes, yes, hubba-hubba
Bop, bop, bop, hubba-hubba
A what you know (A what you know)
A what you say (A what you say)
I say I'll dig you later baby in the USA
