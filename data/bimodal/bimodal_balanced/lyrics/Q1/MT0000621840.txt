Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a-groovin' going to satisfy my soul

Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Send 'em to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room

Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Send 'em to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knocking at the door
Bring him in and fill him up and set him on the floor

Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Send 'em to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

The meat is on the stove
The bread is gettin' hot
Everybody come and taste the possum poppa shot

Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Let's have a party (Let's have a party)
Send 'em to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight
We'll have a party tonight
