Oh, girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms I found my paradise (Ah)
My only chance for happiness (Ah)
And if I lose you now I think I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
Oh, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time

More than a woman (Ooh, come on, baby)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (Ooh, ooh, oh, baby)
More than a woman to me

Ah-ah-ah
Now there are stories old and true
Of people so in love, like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people
Then I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
Oh, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time

More than a woman (You are)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (Ooh, my baby)
More than a woman to me

Ah
More than a woman (Ooh)
More than a woman to me (Oh, so much more)
More than a woman (Oh, babe)
More than a woman to me (Ooh)
More than a woman (Ah)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (Oh, my baby)
More than a woman to me (Ah)
More than a woman (Ah, so much, so much, so much)
More than a woman to me
