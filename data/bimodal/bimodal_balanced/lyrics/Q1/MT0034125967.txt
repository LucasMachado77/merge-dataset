Some people bad and some people good
Too bad the bad can't be like the good
But everything changes a little and it should
Good ain't forever and bad ain't for good

And Lou's got the flu and he's laid up, laid up, laid up
Lou's got the flu and he's laid up
Have to get well pretty soon though

I got sugar in my candy and sugar in my soup
I'm getting fat from the candy and sick from the soup
True love is sweet but if it's mishandled
A bitter wind blows and out goes your candle

And Lou's got the flu and he's laid up, laid up, laid up
Lou's got the flu and he's laid up
Have to get well pretty soon though

Now not enough water puts thirst in a man
And just enough water puts joy in his land
But too much water will overflow
And tear the man's land up, so there you go

And Lou's got the flu and he's laid up, laid up, laid up
Lou's got the flu and he's laid up
Have to get well pretty soon though
