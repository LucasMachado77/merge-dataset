Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free, ooh

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
A world where people care, whoa-oh

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
When all men are equal and none have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today, whoa-oh
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where people are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart, whoa-oh

Someday at Christmas, hmm, hmm, hmm
Someday at Christmas, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time
