Up here in the land of the hot dog stand
The atom bomb and the Good Humor Man
We think our South American neighbors are grand
We love 'em to beat the band

South America, babaloo, babaloo, ayyiyi, babaloo
One favor you can do, ayyiyi, you can do

You beautiful lands below
Don't know what you began
To put it plainly, I'm tired of shakin'
To that Pan American plan

Take back your Samba, ay, your Rumba, ay, your Conga, ayyiyi
I can't keep movin', ay, my chassis, ay, any longer, ayyiyi
Now maybe Latins, ay, in their middles, ay, are built stronger, ayyiyi
But all this takin' to the quakin' and this makin' with the shakin'
Leaves me achin', olé
First shake around and settle there
Then you shake around and settle here
Then you shake around and settle there
That's enough, that's enough, take it back
My spine's outta whack
There's a strange click, clack
In the back of my sacroiliac

Take back your Conga, ay, your Samba, ay, your Rumba, ayyiyi
Why can't you send us, ay, a less strenu, ay, ous number, ayyiyi?
I got more bumps now, ay, than on a, ay, cucumber, ayyiyi
While all those Latin drums are cloppin'
Like a Jumpin' Jack I'm hoppin' without stoppin', olé
South America, take it away

First you shake around and settle there, where?
And then you shake around and settle here, oh, there
And then you shake around and settle there, why Bing?
That's enough, that's enough, take it back
My spine's outta whack
There's a strange click clack
In the back of my sacroiliac, oh, my achin' back

Take back your Conga, ay, your Samba, ay, your Rumba, ayyiyi
Bring back the old days, ay, of dancin', I remember, ayyiyi
My hips are crackin', I am shriekin' ay carumba, ayyiyi
I got a wriggle and a diddle and a jiggle like a fiddle in my middle, olé
This fancy swishin' imposition wears out
All of my transmission ammunition, ol
Though I like neighborly relations, all these crazy new gyrations
Try my patience, olé
South America, take it away
