Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
And then?
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
And then?

I got a girl who lives up on the hill
I got a girl who lives up on the hill
Talk she gonna love me
But I don't believe she will

You got shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker, babe
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
You gotta shake your moneymaker
And then?

I got a girl and she just won't be true
I got a girl and she just won't be true
She's locked to the bridge
She won't do a thing I tell her to do

She won't shake her moneymaker
Won't shake her moneymaker
She wanna roll her activator
She won't shake her moneymaker
She won't shake her moneymaker
She won't?
