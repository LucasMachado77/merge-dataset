I'm the Sheik of Araby
Your love belongs to me
At night when you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep

And the stars that shine above
Will light our way to love
You'll roam this land with me
I'm the Sheik of Araby

Oh, I'm the Sheik of Araby
And all the women worship me
You should see them follow me around. Not bad
Even wives of all the other sheiks
They beg to kiss my rosy cheeks
And that ain't bad -- in fact, that's good, I've found. I'm a cad!
When I lay down to sleep
I'm counting girls instead of sheep
From my harem I can't scare 'em out. Why should I?
They're beauties from all races
And some have pretty faces
I'm the Sheik who knows what love is all about
