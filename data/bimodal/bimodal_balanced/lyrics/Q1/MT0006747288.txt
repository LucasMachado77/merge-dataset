I'll tell me ma when I go home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb
But that's alright till I go home

She is handsome, she is pretty
She is the belle of Belfast City
She is courtin' one, two, three
Please, won't you tell me who is she?

Albert Mooney says he loves her
All the boys are fighting for her
They knock at the door and ring at the bell
Sayin' "Oh, my true love are you well?"

Out she comes as white as snow
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
Ol' Jenny Murray says she'll die
If she doesn't get the fella with the roving eye

I'll tell me ma when I go home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb
But that's alright till I go home

She is handsome, she is pretty
She is the belle of Belfast City
She is courtin' one, two, three
Please, won't you tell me who is she?
Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high
The snow come tumblin' through the sky
She's as nice as apple pie
And she'll get her own lad by and by

When she gets a lad of her own
She won't tell her ma when she gets home
Let them all come as they will
For it's Albert Mooney she loves still

I'll tell me ma when I go home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb
But that's alright till I go home

She is handsome, she is pretty
She is the belle of Belfast City
She is courtin' one, two, three
Please, won't you tell me who is she?

I'll tell me ma when I go home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb
But that's alright till I go home

She is handsome, she is pretty
She is the belle of Belfast City
She is courtin' one, two, three
Please, won't you tell me who is she?
