Lipstick, perfume, I'm running so late, yeah
My girls waitin' outside
High heels, tight dress, music says, and I
Don't even say goodbye

I remember once upon a time
When, when I
Would never ever
Do anything to hurt you, oh yeah
But tonight I'm gonna...

I'ma take this ring off
Take this ring off my, my finger
Take this ring off
Take this ring off my, my left hand
Get my thing off
Get my thing all the way off, yeah
That's what I'ma do
That's what I'ma do
That's what I'ma do
That's what I'ma do

Don't tell nobody
Don't tell nobody, oh no
Don't tell nobody, yeah

Late night, I'm feelin' nice
Tryin' to make sure we, we can be alone
So I stopped at the Rite Aid
Headed up to his place
Feels so right
Just can't be wrong

I remember once upon a time
When, when I
Would never ever
Do anything to hurt you, oh yeah
But tonight I'm gonna
Tonight, I'm gonna, yeah

I'ma take this ring off
Take this ring off my, my finger
Take this ring off
Take this ring off my, my left hand
Get my thing off
Get my thing all the way off, yeah
