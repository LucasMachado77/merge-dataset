Yippie yay
There'll be not wedding bells for today

'Cause I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
(Jingle, jangle)
As I go ridin' merrily along
(Jingle, jangle)
And they sing, "Oh, ain't you glad you're single"
(Jingle, jangle)
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
(Jingle, jangle)

Oh, Lillie Belle
(Lillie Belle)
Oh, Lillie Belle
(Lillie Belle)
Though I may have done some foolin'
This is why I never fell

'Cause I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
(Jingle, jangle)
As I go ridin' merrily along
(Jingle, jangle)
And they sing, "Oh, ain't you glad you're single"
(Jingle, jangle)
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
(Jingle, jangle)
Oh, I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
(I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle)
As I go ridin' merrily along
(I go ridin' merrily along)
And they sing, "Oh, ain't you glad you're single"
(And they sing, "Oh, ain't you glad you're single")
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
(And that song ain't so very far from wrong)

Oh, Lillie Belle
Oh, Lillie Belle
Though I may have done some foolin'
This is why I never fell

'Cause I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
(I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle)
As I go ridin' merrily along
(I go ridin' merrily along)
And they sing, "Oh, ain't you glad you're single"
(And they sing, "Oh, ain't you glad you're single")
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
(And that song ain't so very far from wrong)
