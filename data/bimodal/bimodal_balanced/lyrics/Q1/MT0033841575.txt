Ow!

Do anything you want
But never find the heart to leave me
'Cause I need you too much
So play your game, but don't desert me
Maybe you heard I'm tough
To love but, baby, please believe me

Don't be afraid to trust me (Trust me)
I wouldn't trade you for the world
And if you feel you gotta test me
Before you be my girl

Then you can shake me
You can break me
But you can't make me
(Kill our love)
'Cause that's the only thing I won't
Do for you

Sometimes I say too much (Say too much)
I am right now, so please forgive me
When I can't help but touch (Help but touch)
The place so deep inside you in me
I threw away my crutch (Away my crutch)
I'm running for you, can't you see me?
Don't be afraid to try me (Try me)
Come on and give a guy your world
And if you feel you gotta test me
Before you be my girl

Then you can shake me
You can break me
But you can't make me
(Kill our love)
'Cause that's the only thing I won't
Do for you

We're always making love inside your mind
Somebody take me to the other side
I wanna get so deep inside your world
So don't run away, girl

You can shake me
You can break me
But you can't make me
(Kill our love)
'Cause that's the only thing I won't
Do for you
Shake me
You can break me (Oh, yeah)
But you can't make me
(Kill our love)
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna make you mine
You can shake me
(You take me to the edge
And I'll jump off the ledge)
You can break me
(If it will make you mine
I'll lose a leg, go blind)
But you can't make me
(I'll sail a thousand ships
To find and kiss your lips)
'Cause that's the only thing I won't
Do for you
You can shake me
(You take me to the edge
And I'll jump off the ledge)
You can break me
(If it will make you mine
I'll lose a leg, go blind)
But you can't make me
(I'll sail a thousand ships
To find and kiss your lips)
