Yippe yai yippe yo kaiya, yee hoo!
I'm Big Bad Bill from the Badlands,
And I'm riding into town tonight.
Oh, I'm rough and tough and ready,
And my trigger fingers steady,
And my dukes is always itchin' for a fight.

Yippe yai yippe yo kaiya!
I'm Big Bad Bill from the Badlands,
I'm a better shot than Daniel Boone.
Ain't nobody's draw's quicker,
When I shoot a man a snicker,
Him that crosses me is loco as a loon.
I'm so dog goned tough that when I see a rattlesnake around,
I tie him in a desert knot and throw him on the ground.

I'm Big Bad Bill from the Badlands,
And I'm riding into town tonight.
Yippe yai yippe yo kaiya!
Yippe yai yippe yo kaiya!
I'm Big Bad Bill from the Badlands,
And I'm going to hit the hills or bust.
I'll go riding through that mountain,
Six gun spraying like a fountain,
I'll make every living critter bite the dust!

Yippe yai yippe yo kaiya!
I'm Big Bad Bill from the Badlands,
Everybody runs when I appear.
Every cussed mountain lion
Takes a look and then starts a flyin'
And the buzzards stay up in the stratosphere.
Just for laughs I like to grab a bull and hold him by the tail,
I swing him 'round a coupla times and then I let him sail.

I'm Big Bad Bill from the naughty, naughty, lands,
And I'm madder than a rattler's bite.
Cause my wife wont let me out tonight,
rrrgh! My wife wont let me out tonight!
