Down the oceanside, all my tears subside
But I feel I see my baby
I can't wait today -- don't want it to end this way
But I, I wanna be your man, be your man

Won't you be my baby? Hey, yeah
Won't you be my baby girl?
Oh, won't you be my baby?
Be my special girl, whoa-oh-oh

Every time I see you run
It seems like I'm having fun
But I, I wanna be your man
Every time I see you cry, every time I wonder why
Figure I oughta hold your hand, hold your hand

Won't you be my lady? Oh, baby
Won't you be my baby girl? Hey, girl
Won't you be my baby?
Be my special girl, oh oh yeah

Won't you be my lady? Hey, hey
Won't you be my baby girl? Hey, yeah
Won't you be my lady?
Be my, be my special girl, yeah, yeah
Won't you be my lady? Hey, ho
Won't you be my baby girl? Hey
Won't you be my lady?
Be my, be my special girl, hey, hey, yeah
Won't you be my lady? Yeah, seems so good to me
Won't you be my baby? Hey hey, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Won't you be my baby? Baby, baby, baby
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, oh
Won't you be my lady? Ow
Won't you be my baby girl? Hey, hey
