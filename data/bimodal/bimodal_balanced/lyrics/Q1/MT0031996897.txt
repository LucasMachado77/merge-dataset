I don't need lots of people, tellin' me what to do
I don't need a long haired lady, to love me true as true
All I need is a rock'n'roll band...somewhere new to play
And I'm on my way, I'm on my way

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone

My life isn't easy baby, it's the life that I need
I got music livin' inside of me, I gotta set it free
All I need is a rock'n'roll band...somewhere new to play
And I'm on my way, I'm on my way

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone

Playin' music babe, is all I know
Where it wants to take me honey...

All I want from livin' is just to be left alone
All I need is an open road, 'cause I'm a rollin' stone
All I need is a rock'n'roll band...somewhere new to play
And I'm on my way, I'm on my way

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, momma I don't need no one

I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, and I'm on the run
I'm a rock'n'roll outlaw, I never needed anyone
