Baby I love you so, and never let you go
I'm looking for your face, waiting for warm embrace
I'm living in the space, I'm following your trace
Tell me what's going on, tell me what's going on
I'm gonna make you queen, girl have you ever seen

Oh baby come to me, baby just come to me
Don't break my heart tonight, swinging my soul desire
Baby just come to me, be what you wanna be
Using your fantasy, I need your soul to see

Baby just come to me, now we can do it right
Holding each other tight, now we can make it right
I promise you delight, waiting until daylight
I gotta have the key, open your heart to me
Now I can set you free, be what you wanna be
Don't wanna live alone, I gotta be so strong
Don't wanna be alone
