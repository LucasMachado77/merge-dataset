I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble

But there's something 'bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something 'bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Oh baby, said you knock me off my feet

I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
And I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you, baby
That only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble

But there's something 'bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something 'bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Oh baby, said you knock me off my feet

I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I...ooh, ooh, honey
I don't wanna bore you with it
Ooh but I love you, I love you, love you
And I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
