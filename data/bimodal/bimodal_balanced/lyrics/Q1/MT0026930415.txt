Well, here comes the bride, no less
It's hot stuff, that fluffy dress
From where I sit, I'll admit
She looks a bit sweet

No wonder her Romeo
Begins shoutin' "Hidy-ho!"
As his bride starts to stride
To a boogie beat

There's a big increase in marriages
Due to a tune, they say
The Wedding Cakewalk
Is the roundelay

When newlyweds in fancy carriages
Leave that reception gay
The Wedding Cakewalk
Sends them on their way

Pasty choirs in tasty churches
Gives it all they've got
Prudish old preachers on their perches
Say, "A-men, it's hot!"

All those bridal suites at Claridge's
Have radios that play
The Wedding Cakewalk
Night and day!

There's a big increase in marriages
Due to a tune, they say
The Wedding Cakewalk
Is the roundelay

When newlyweds in fancy carriages
Leave that reception gay
Oh Wedding Cakewalk
Sends them on their way

Pasty choirs in tasty churches
Give it all they've got
Prudish old preachers on their perches
Say, "A-men, it's hot!"

All those bridal suites at Claridge's
Have radios that play
The Wedding Cakewalk
Night and day!
