Well I wake up in the night now
And don't you know I think of you
It's the fire in your eyes
That keeps on cutting through
There's nowhere I can run to
Can't seem to lose the thought of you
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again

Well I used to walk the straight line
I knew what I was doing all the time
There was nothing left to move me
I always held my ground
But you got me where you want me
And now you're always here to haunt me
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
I still remember how it felt when you put your arms around me
But if I thought you could love me, I was blind

But you got me where you want me
And now you're always here to haunt me
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again

Well you'd think I would've learned by now
And I'd keep away from you somehow
Just like a little child
I keep coming back for more
But baby when you come today
Don't you know that I'll come out and play
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
Woah I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
