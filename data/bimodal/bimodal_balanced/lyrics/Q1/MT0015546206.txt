(All night long I wait)

Yeah, hey, mama
Kick time at the bed, I'm coming over
Got something to show you
Behold your ass
I's wanna hold you, just hold you tight
Like a four-leaf clover, I be goin' through 
Your flowers, baby, your garden's open
A sight for sore eyes
Good lord, I'm focused
'Cause I can hardly notice anything other 
Than the woman with the face of my future baby mother 

I'm a big man, she's a big girl
Put on them heels, put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream, she's a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Let's play rough we can get wild
I could go home, but I'll stay
Cheat but I won't

So I go by Weezy 
Love me or leave me
I hate to leave her
I think I need her
She's such a teaser
Such a diva
I could park right here, baby fuck the meter
Do it to me, baby, I could be your receiver
Call me in the last minute, I could be your reliever
Call me at the last minute, I be that evenin'
Late night, early morning, maybe this evenin'

She ain't no stunt, she ain't no philly
I wanna get mad, but then not really
She's so fly I could get mine
But I do it much better with her by my side
Love's all right
We gon' get blitzed tonight
All my girls wanna make that money
All my thugs wanna take that money
All night long I'm a milk that honey, so

All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All in the day and whenever you get, all night long

All night long I wait
To see you naked
And watch the sunrise in your face
All night long I wait for you to play
And let my open arms take you away

Yeah, yeah, yeah, she said she wanna be the one I get next to
Yes, boo, let's do dat
Who dat? You dat
When I want to be the one, I get next to
Let's move get you to the crib
Now I see you as the
One I wanna give sex to
Sex you
Sexy you
You sexy devil you
Angel, lookin' like you're single
Thank you
Have yourself a drink
I drink too, saw you when I came through
Now I can't do nothin' if it ain't you
It's Wayne, boo, I don't do what them lames do
I come at you from a whole 'nother angle
Now, one time for the ladies in the high skirts
Two times for the ladies in the tight jeans
Three times for the ladies who ain't got no panties on
Let's go home

All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All in the day and whenever you get, all night long

All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All in the day and whenever you get, all night long

All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All in the day and whenever you get, all night long
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All in the day and whenever you get, all night long
