Think about the places we've had our little fun
In the church at Christmas, busted by that nun
Then in that museum, beneath the Mastodon
Stating our positions on the White House lawn

All you ever think about is sex
All you ever think about exclusively
All you ever think about is sex, all right with me

Say, do you remember the Dodgers and the Mets
50,000 people saw us and turned red
I'm still not recovered from Saturday's faux pas
When your father came home, saw us, and dropped dead

All you ever think about is sex
All you ever think about exclusively
All you ever think about is sex, all right with me
In a world of lovers, we don't love each other much
Fact is, we're too busy to love each other much

All you ever think about is sex
All you ever think about exclusively
All you ever think about is sex, all right with me
