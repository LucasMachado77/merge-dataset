Dreadlocks flying through the air!
And all I ve got is love to share
Do you really love me yeah?
Do you really love me yeah?

I m a Reggae Rocker, do you love me?
Six feets tall, straight from over the all, do you love me?
I play the music that I love, do you love me?
For pressure stands from up above, do you love me?

He s the Rocker, she s the Rocker
Rock it to my melody
I m rocking, you re rocking
To my Reggae melody!

To my Reggae melody!

He s the Rocker, she s the Rocker
