When we're all alone and I'm in your arms
Are you teasing me
When you're tellin' me how you thrill to my charms
Are you teasing me?

Are you untrue when I'm not with you
When we're apart are you free
Tell me dariing while our love is still young
Are you teasing me?

You say that my kiss sends your heart in a whirl
Are you teasing me
And that youll be mine till the end of the world
Are you teasing me?
