Hard times, hard times in Canaan land
Trouble in the mind of a man
A voice came whispering softly to him
Go offer, offer up the lamb

Abraham took his only son
High up on a hill
His test of faith had finally come
As the wind, the wind begin to chill

Cold steel, cold steel in the father's hand
Tears falling from the sky
The angels, the angels did not understand
Why the righteous, the righteous boy should die

Abraham most mysteriously
Laid down that deadly knife
Said, "My darlin' son, I wish I was the one
Who spared you, spared your precious life"

Oh Isaac, the light of all your days
Will shine upon this mountain high
And never, never fade away
And never fade away
