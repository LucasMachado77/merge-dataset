It's been a long time since you went away
I stop to think of you most everyday
With all my heart, I'm hoping you're okay

Guess who loves you?
Somebody loves you

I couldn't reach you by the U.S. Mail
You didn't leave a very easy trail
I tried the telephone to no avail

Guess who loves you?
Somebody loves you, I do

Someone loves you

Somebody loves you
Mind over matter is the game I play
I'll never reach you any other way
So I send this one thought to you everyday

Guess who loves you?
Somebody loves you, I do

Someone loves you
Somebody loves you, I do

Someone loves you
Somebody loves you
