Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia

Christ, the Saviour, is born
Christ, the Saviour, is born

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
