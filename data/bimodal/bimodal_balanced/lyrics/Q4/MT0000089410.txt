You're so sweet and warm
Like the summer sun
You're far away, my dear
I can see your face so clear
Making me happy
The world can('t) understand

The shadow of your smile
(You to me)
When you are gone
(You bring happiness here, your love is super good)
Mhm (You're so for real)
Will color all of my dreams, oh, oh oh, hey, hey
And light the dawn, you, woo
Look into my eyes, oh baby
And all the lovely things you are to me
(I love you, I love you) Ooh
Our wishful little star was far too high, oh my darling
Well, a teardrop kissed your lips, oh
And so did I, yes Lord

Now, now when I remember spring
All the joy love can bring (In love with you, dear)
Oh girl, I'll be remembering
The shadow of your smile
(You're my inspiration, you're everything in life to me)
Oh, so, so, so
(You're my everything if I should die)
