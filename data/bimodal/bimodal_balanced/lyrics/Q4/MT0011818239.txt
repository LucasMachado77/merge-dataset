Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
Sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and brig
ht
And bring you closer to me
Before you go
There's just one thing I'd like to know
Is your love still warm for me
Or has it gone cold?

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fears
For I'll be there, you know I care
Please give your love to me only

Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
Sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fears
For I'll be there, you know I care
Please give your love to me

Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
Sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
And bring you closer to me

Goodnight, my love
