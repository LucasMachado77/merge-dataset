Silent is the night
Winter magic outside
Angels they started to sing
Let a new kingdom begin

All my wishes come true
When I'm thinking of you
Love is the gift that you bring
Let a new kingdom begin

Saviour of all mankind
Hope is what we can find
Come and forgive us our sins
Let a new kingdom begin

Greatest Lord of all lords
Fighter without any sword
Conquer each heart from within
Let a new kingdom begin
