I think of you, my love, not as a stranger
Although it's true, my love, we've only met
Yet I know your smile and I know your sigh
Know them well from dreams I can't forget

We've kissed like this before, you're not a stranger
A thousand times or more 'neath stars above
Now the path is clear, for at last you're here
Not as a stranger, dear, but my own true love

We've kissed like this before, you're not a stranger
A thousand times or more 'neath stars above
Now the path is clear, for at last you're here
Not as a stranger, dear, but my own true love
