O holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, oh night when Christ was born

O night divine, oh night oh night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we

Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord
Let ever, ever, praise we
Noel, Noel
O night, o night divine
O night, divine, o night
O holy night
