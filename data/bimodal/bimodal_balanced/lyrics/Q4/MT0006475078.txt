You're the right one
Yes, the right one
I have never been so sure
Of anyone before

You're the first time
And the last time
You're the one time
There'll be no more

You're the star that always seems so far
But darling, here you are
For all the world to see
So if you love me
Say you love me
For I know that you're the right one for me
You're the star that always seems so far
But darling here you are
For all the world to see
So if you love me
Say you love me
For I know you're the right one for me
