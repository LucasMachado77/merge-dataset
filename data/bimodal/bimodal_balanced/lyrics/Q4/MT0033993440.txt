Ooh, I see and I saw
Woah, woah
Yeah, yeah

I saw Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion

Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion

Everything seemed so real
The warmness of Jah
I could feel His love filled me up
Oh Lord, I don't wanna wake up

I saw Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion

We were all singing the same song
Giving praises to the Almighty One
All I could feel was happiness
Surrounded by righteousness

I saw Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion

Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion

There's no room for di ungodly
None for the workers of iniquity
Only pure in hearts and clean minds
So be good all ye little ones

I saw Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion

Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion

Everything seemed so real
The warmness of Jah
I could feel His love filled me up
Oh Lord, I don't wanna wake up

I saw Zion in a vision
Yeah, yeah
(Eh)

We were all singing the same song
Giving praises to the almighty one
All I could feel was happiness
Surrounded by righteousness

I saw Zion in a vision, I mean it
Zion in a vision, yeah, yeah, yeah

I saw Zion in a vision
Jah was there, amidst everyone
Stretching forth His right hand
Oh, it's like a family reunion
