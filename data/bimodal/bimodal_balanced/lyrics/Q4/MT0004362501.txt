(One)
Thou shalt never love another
(Two)
But stand by me in all the while
(Three) Take happiness with the heartaches
(Four) Go through life wearing a smile

And how happy we will be
With the ten commandments of love, oh, love, of love

(Five)
Thou shalt always have faith in me and in everything I say and do
(Six)
Love me with all your heart and soul, until our life, our precious life on earth is through

And how happy we will be
With the ten commandments of love, oh, love, of love

Love, oh, love, oh, sweet love
I said it's oh, oh, so grand
But, yes it is
Such as you could find, since the beginning of time
It has proved in all the land

(Seven)
Come to me when I am lonely
(Eight)
Kiss me when you hold me tight
(Nine)
Keep me, all you gotta do is treat me warm and tender
(Ten)
Gentle caresses and always do right
You got to do right

And how happy we will be
With the ten commandments of love, of love

And how happy we will be
With the ten commandments of love
