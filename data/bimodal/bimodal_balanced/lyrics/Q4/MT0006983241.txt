Now look fellas
I've been walking around the North Pole with ya for two days
And I'm cold and tired and, well
Where's the surprise you brought me here to see?

Around the next corner

There he is!

Hi, Rudolph!

Hello, Rudolph

Hi, old pal

Who's Rudolph, boys?

Who's Rudolph?! Tell him, Ruddy!

I'm Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
I have a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They'd never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say (that's my boss)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won'tcha guide my sleigh tonight

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

Hey, you sing good, Ruddy!

That was fine.

Yeah, good for you, Ruddy!

Aw shucks, fellas

Say fellas, it's awfully cold out here
I'm gonna see if I can find myself a nice warm igloo
Try to get along without me, if you possibly can
Because I have to get

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say

Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

By the way, what do you want for Christmas, Simon?

I want a real live pony

How about it, Alvin?

Well, first I still want that hula hoop, (ok) and a
