O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
O they tell me of a home far away
O they tell me of a place where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day

O they tell me of a place where my friends have gone
O they tell me of that land far away
Where the Tree of Life in eternal bloom
Sheds its fragrance on an uncloudy day

O the land of cloudless day
O the land of an uncloudy sky
O they tell me of a place where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of uncloudy day

O they tell me that He smiles on His children there
And His smile drives their sorrows away
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
In that lovely land of uncloudy day

O the land of cloudless day
O the land of an uncloudy day
O they tell me of a place where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day
O they tell me of an uncloudy day
O they tell me of an uncloudy day
O they tell me of an uncloudy day
