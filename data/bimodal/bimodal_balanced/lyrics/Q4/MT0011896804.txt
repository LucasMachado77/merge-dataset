Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
For no matter how far away you roam
When you long for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home

I met a man who lives in Tennessee and he was heading for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
From Pennsylvania folks are travelling down to Dixie's sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee, the traffic is terrific

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home
