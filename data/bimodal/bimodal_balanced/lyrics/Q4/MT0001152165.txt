I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight
And all that you mean to me
I used to think I would never fall in love again
I guess I was wrong

When your heart is broken
When your wounded pride is laid to rest, baby
You'll never open your heart to anyone else you say
But you lie, I know you're lyin', baby
You see your mind might be made up, mmm
But your heart has got it's own plans
There's no one to blame for false pride, tellin' lies
Tryin' to hide from feelin' the pain
I know you don't wanna feel it

There's nowhere to hide
When the love is callin' your name in from the dark
Nowhere to hide, baby, yeah
There's nowhere to hide
So let love have it's way, with your heart
When love calls, love calls, love calls your name

It's on my lips
And I wish that you were still here
To take me away with your kiss
And take me away from all this crazy, crazy
'Cause too many words have been spoken, mmm
Too many lies have been told, baby
You'll never do it again you tell yourself
Over, and over, and over
You're wrong, dead wrong, babe, yeah

There's nowhere to hide, mmm
When love is callin' your name in from the dark, baby
Nowhere to run, girl
There's nowhere to hide, yeah
So let love have its way, girl, with your heart, babe
Love calls, love calls
There's nowhere to hide, yeah
When love is calls your name you fall apart, baby
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run when love is
On its way, girl, to your heart, baby
When love calls, love calls your name, babe

Love's callin' your name, hey, hey
It's callin' out for you, callin' out for me, baby
Love's on its way, baby, ay-ee, ay, ay, ay
Now, I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you

I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight
And how you make me feel
The sweetness of your touch
The softness of your voice, mmm
You make me wanna be a better man, baby
And I wanna thank you for calling me into your life
Into your arms, into your love
