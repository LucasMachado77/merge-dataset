Smooth, suave, debonair
Describes a man so rare
Like fine wine
He gets mellower with age
He's the man with the horn

He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on
He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on, yeah

His music sets the pace
But masters never have to race
Although he's much too fast
To ever lose
He's the man with the horn

He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on
He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on, yeah

He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on
He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on, yeah

He's been so many years
Crying melodies for tears
Yeah, but they don't they don't understand
What makes this man

He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on
He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Blow on, blow on, yeah

He's the man, he's the man with the horn
The man keeps on blowing, yeah
He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Your mind keeps on blowing
He's the man, he's the man with the horn
He's been out there so many years
He's the man, he's the man with the horn
Crying melodies for tears
He's the man, he's the man with the horn

He's the man, he's the man with the horn
He's been out there so many years
