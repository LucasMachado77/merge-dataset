Each time I see you
I love you more and more and more and more
My Darling
Each time I'm with you
I love you more and more and more and more
Darling you fill each day of the year
with happiness to me you're so dear
And darling you cheer me whenever you're near me and each time
I love you more
(More, more, I love you more)
Darling, each time I kiss you
I love you more and more and more and more
And darling, each time that I miss you
Yes, I miss you more and more and more
Darling you make me feel inside
A feeling of faith and a feeling of bright
And darling you cheer me whenever you're near me and
each time I love you more
(More, more, more, I love you more)
