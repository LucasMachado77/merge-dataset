She might get a little quiet
And curl up with her book
Then out of nowhere
She'll give me that look
She'll take me in her arms
Just like it's been so long
Just when I think I've got her figured out
I don't

She's a woman
Guaranteed to change her mind
As quickly as she changed my life
A woman
With more love in her little finger
And a heart that never waivers
Without her I'd be nothin'
She's a woman

She'll stare at her closet
And say I ain't got a thing to wear
And for reasons I don't know
She might cut her hair
I tell her how I love it
She shakes her head just like a child
When I think she's gonna break down and cry
She smiles

She's a woman
Guaranteed to change her mind
As quickly as she changed my life
A woman
With more love in her little finger
And a heart that never waivers
Without her I'd be nothin'
She's a woman

She might get a little quiet
And curl up with her book
