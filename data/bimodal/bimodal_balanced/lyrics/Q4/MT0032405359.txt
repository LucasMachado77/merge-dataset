Played a weddin' for the money
And I wish I could've told the bride and groom
Just what I think of marriage
What's in store after the honeymoon?

I was rumblin' through the verses
'Bout how men and women ought to live apart
How a promise never made
Cannot be broken and can never break a heart

Suddenly from out of nowhere
This little girl came spinning across the floor
Her crinolines were billowing beneath
The skirt of calico she wore

As her joy fell on the honored guests
Each one of them was drawn into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands
And hollered at her, "Dance, little Jean"

And they said, dance little Jean
This day is for you
Two people that you love
Stood up to say I do

Dance, little Jean
A prayer that you had
Was answered today
Your mom is marrying your dad

Well, the cynics heart just melted
As I figure what this gift together meant
And how it ended years of tears
And sad confusion that the little girl had spent

They told the band to pack it up
About the time the couple cut the cake
But we stayed and we played all night long
For love and laughs and little Jeannie sake

We played dance, little Jean
This day is for you
Two people that you love
Stood up to say I do

Dance, little Jean
A prayer that you had
Was answered today
Your mom is marrying your dad

And we said dance little Jean
This day is for you
Two people that you love
Stood up to say I do

Dance, little Jean
A prayer that you had
Was answered today
Your mom is marrying your dad
