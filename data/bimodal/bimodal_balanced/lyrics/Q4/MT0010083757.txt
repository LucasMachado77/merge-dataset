Well, come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
And if you stay, you'll see I can bring you lots of joy
I can turn those little teardrops to a smile

If you're blue, don't cry, just wander right downtown
You can find your delta momma waiting there
I thought you knew that I would never let you down
I can ease your mind and take away all your cares

Come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
If you stay, you'll see I can bring you lots of joy
I can turn those little teardrops to a smile

If the grass grows brown, don't you hang your head too low
There ain't no need for you to sit and pine
If you just ask around, then I'm sure someone will know
Just exactly what it takes to get you back to feeling fine

Well, come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
If you stay, you'll see I can bring you lots of joy
I can turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, if you don't know by now what I've been trying so hard to say
Well, my delta boy, I'm afraid you're up too tight
But take it slow and somehow you come meandering out my way
And I'll take you in my arms and make it right

Well, come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
And if you stay, you'll see I can bring you lots of joy
I can turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
