Wish I were down on some blue bayou
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
But the road I'm on don't seem to go there
So I just dream, keep on being the way I am

Wish I enjoyed what makes my living
Did what I do with a willing hand
Some would run, but that ain't like me
So I just dream and keep on being the way I am

The way I am don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see that bobber dancing
But I just dream, keep on being the way I am

The way I am don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see that bobber dancing
But I just dream, keep on being the way I am

I just dream, keep on being the way I am
