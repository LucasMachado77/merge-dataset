Why do lovers drift apart
And how does love fade away
When do pieces of a broken heart mend again
You've been crying in the dark
And you've been feeling alone
Don't be scared of what you'll find
When you turn the light on

Ain't nobody gonna say goodbye
No, ain't nobody gonna walk away
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you
Like I love you

What sad memory of yesterday
what terrible scar
Keeps you gathering pieces of
Your shattered heart
There was once upon a time
When hope was living within
I know there will come a time
When you can believe again

Ain't nobody gonna say goodbye
No, ain't nobody gonna walk away
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you
Like I love you

How long have you been feeling lonely
How long have you been feeling sad and blue

This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you
Like I love you
