Baby, let's cruise
Away from here
Don't be confused
The way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
This is not a one night stand...
Baby, yeah

So, let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find

You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby tonight
Belongs to us
Everything right
Do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every lil' part of each other
Ooh baby yeah

So, let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find

You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Cruise with me baby
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Oh, baby, let's cruise
Let's float, let's glide
Oohh, let's open up
And go inside

And if you want it, you got it forever
I could just stay here beside you and love you, baby
Let the music take your mind
Just release and
You will find

You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when... I love it, I love it, I love it
Oh, cruise with me, baby
I love it when we're cruisin' together
