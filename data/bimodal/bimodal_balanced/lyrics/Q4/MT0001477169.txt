It won't be long till I'll be leaving
It won't be long till I'll say goodbye
It won't be long till I'll be leaving
But I hope to meet you in the sky

Oh, I'm gonna join that heavenly van
I'm gonna join that heavenly van
Won't it be so bright and fair
When we meet loved ones up there
When we join that heavenly van

Won't it be so sweet to be with Jesus
After my burdens are laid down
This life on earth, I'd gladly exchange it
Exchange it for a starry crown
Oh, I'm gonna join that heavenly van
I'm gonna join that heavenly van
Won't it be so bright and fair
When we meet loved ones up there
When we join that heavenly van

Dear brother, be ready to meet your Savior
It won't be long, it maybe soon
We have no promise of tomorrow
So meet me their, there's plenty of room

Oh, I'm gonna join that heavenly van
I'm gonna join that heavenly van
Won't it be so bright and fair
When we meet loved ones up there
When we join that heavenly van
