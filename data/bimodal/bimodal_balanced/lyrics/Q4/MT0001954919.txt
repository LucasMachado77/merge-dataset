Thought I heard you call my name
And I whispered on the wind
And I remember you were going
Never coming back again

But if love is what we believe in
I'll see you in heaven's first bright star
If seeing is believing
I look into the skies and there you are
You're not that far
'Cause love is what we believe in
Looking through some photographs
From not so long ago
Right now, I'd give anything
If I had only known
I would never touch you, hold you
Or kiss your face
Feel your arms around me
Or fall in your embrace

But if love is what we believe in
I'll see you in heaven's first bright star
If seeing is believing
I look into the skies and there you are
You're not that far
'Cause love is what we believe in

Now love will break your heart
When you say goodbye
But love is worth the pain
And all tears you cry

And if seeing is believing
I look into the skies and there you are
You're not that far
'Cause love is what we believe in
And you are in my heart
And our love is what I believe in
