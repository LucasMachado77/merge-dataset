I stop for a while on my favourite corner
Imagine, a idren come up to I and say me glad you come on ya
A long time me nuh eat, him say
Me nuh have nowhere fe sleep

I beg you let off supm, running's well sharp
Let off supm, even buy me a-half
Let off supm, give I man a-match
The idren say, let off supm, cyant stand the pace
Let off supm, me dey pon me face
Let off supm, no careless smile no hesitate -- yeah

A wey we a-go do now
Tell me, when it a-go end
This ya time well crucial
And the pressure's getting brutal

So let off supm, me dey pon me face
Let off supm, cyant stand the pace
Let off supm, no careless smile, no hesitate
Idren say (let off supm)
