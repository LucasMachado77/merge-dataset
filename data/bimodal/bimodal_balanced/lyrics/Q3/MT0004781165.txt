Never miss your water till your well run dry
Never miss your water till your well run dry

You know you never miss your little woman until she says goodbye
Whoa you know, I'm my papa's baby, I'm my mama's baby child
You know I'm my papa's baby, oh mama's baby child
Whoa you know you never miss your water, Lord until your well go dry

You know I've been wonderin', what makes a well run dry?
Whoa you know, I've been wonderin', wonderin', oh boy what makes a well run dry?
You know that's when the earth done settle down on the water
Ain't no more water passing by
