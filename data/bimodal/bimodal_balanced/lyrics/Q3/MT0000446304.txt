Never knew the point of No Return til I crossed it
Never knew there could be Love Supreme til I lost it
Playing solo seemed ultra-cool - now it's clear
Our mid-winter goodbye must be why
Spring ain't here

Buds unopening refuse to bloom in low pressure
I feel like the man who lost the map to his treasure
Will the notes that I sing ever stop turning blue?
I'm unsprung like the Spring i the absence of you

Increasingly, I start to see
Why Spring ain't here
A wiser man, I understand
Why Spring ain't here

Wintertime just won't break, like the calendar's rusted
Where is April and May, is the equinox busted?
My mistakes was in letting you disappear
Our French film-like goodbye must be why
Spring ain't here

Increasingly, I start to see why
Spring ain't here
I can't demote my overcoat cause
Spring Ain't here
I still am seem in L.L.Bean cause
Spring ain't here
Turn up the song and don't be long....
Make Spring be here
