Put yourself in my place
And you wouldn't do the things you do to me
If you put yourself in my place
You'd know the meaning of misery

Sleepless nights, tossing and turning
Days and nights of worry and wondering
Put yourself in my place
Then you will realize why there are tears
So many tears in my eyes

How can you stand there and tell me
That girl was just an old friend, oh baby
When I seen you with her
Time and time again

You tell me she doesn't mean a thing to you
But in the meanwhile, baby, just look what I'm going through
If you put yourself in my place
You wouldn't see her anymore

Put yourself in my place
You would learn to treat me right
Put yourself in my place
You wouldn't stay out late at night

Put yourself in my place
Ohh, darling, just try it
Put yourself in my place

Put yourself in my place
You'd learn to treat me right
And you wouldn't stay out late at night
