Sister Mary she wears a golden chain
Sister Mary she wears a golden chain
Sister Mary wears the golden chain
There's every link in Jesus' name
There's no hiding place down here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
Well, I run to the rock just to hide my face
The rocks cried out, no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

I'll pitch my tent on the old camp-ground
I'll pitch my tent on the old camp-ground
I'll pitch my tent on the old camp-ground
I'll give old Satan one more round
There's no hiding place down here

Oh, the Devil wears a hypocrite's shoe

And if you don't watch he'll slip it on you
There's no hiding place down here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
Well, I run to the rock just to hide my face
The rocks cried out, no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here
