Well you gotta quit me baby and go on down the road
You gotta quit me baby and go on down the road
I'm gonna miss you boy, cos you're my so and so

I know we've had our fights, we fight like cats and dogs
I know we've had our fights, we fight like cats and dogs
But we can make it right boy, I'll let you be the boss

Sometimes the things you say baby, make me feel so bad
Sometimes the things you say baby, make me feel so bad
Now you wanna runaway boy from the best girl you have had

You know when rob me baby, you make me feel so good
You know when rob me baby, you make me feel so good
Don't run off boy, do me like you should

I wanna get your Buick baby and ride around the world
I wanna get your Buick baby and ride around the world
All I ever wanna do boy, is just to be your girl

I wanna get your Buick baby and ride around the world
I wanna get your Buick baby and ride around the world
All I ever wanna do boy, is just to be your girl
