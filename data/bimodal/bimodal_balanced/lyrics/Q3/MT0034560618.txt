I've got a sad sad story, friend, that I don't like to tell
I had a home and family when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years, that's a long long time, I know
But time don't mean a thing to me 'cause I've got life to go

Well, I went one night where the lights were bright
Just to see what I could see
I met up with an old friend who just thought the world of me
He brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
Then words were said and now he's dead, I just had to bring him down

Well, it's been a long long time now since I've heard from my wife
Yes, I'd be there with her yet, if I hadn't used the knife
Well, I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go

Well, I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
No, I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
I've been in here eighteen years and still got life to go

Yes, I've still got life to go, yea, I've still got life to go
Yes, I've still got life to go, yea, I've still got life to go
