Tonight with another I'm dancing and we're smiling at the rest of the crowd
But I can't help wondering about you and your new love to whom you're so proud
At night I'm never alone I'm afraid that I'll weaken and phone
And I'm afarid that you will be gone I'm with a crowd but oh so alone

I still have the picture you gave me you signed it with love you'll recall
And the one of me that you wanted isn't now hanging face to the wall
At night I'm never alone...

As long as I can keep smiling maybe I can fool the world don't you see
And perhaps some day I'll forget you and lose this heartache that you left with me
At night I'm never alone...
