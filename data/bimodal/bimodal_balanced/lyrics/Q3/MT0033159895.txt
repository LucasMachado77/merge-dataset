What am I gonna do girl, what am I gonna do
I love you so much, what am I gonna do
What am I gonna do girl, what am I gonna do
I love you so much, what am I gonna do?

Sittin' here and thinkin' 'bout you so far away
Wondering what you're thinkin', wondering what you'd say
If you were sittin' here beside me, here alone beside me
Used to be so good with you baby baby.

What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do
I love you so much, what am I gonna do?

You left me here alone said it all takes time
I should keep the place together keep everything in line
Why aren't you sittin' here beside me here alone beside me
Till you come back to me baby baby.

What am I gonna do girl, what am I gonna do
I love you so much, what am I gonna do
What am I gonna do girl, what am I gonna do
I love you so much, what am I gonna do?...
