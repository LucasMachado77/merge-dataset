Oh girl, just tell me
What you are dealing with, I wanna know
Oh girl, just tell me what you are dealing with
I wanna know, I wanna know
Oh girl, I want to know, oh yes

We made arrangement to meet
Each other at the bus stop after school
And how you let me wait there
As if I'm fool, as if I'm fool
Oh yes, as if I'm fool, oh yes

If you're looking for someone to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
'Cause I'm a big man, girl
No, I'm not a boy, I'm not a boy, oh no
I'm not a boy, oh no

Oh girl, just tell me
What you are dealing with, I wanna know
Oh girl, just tell me what you are dealing with
I wanna know, I wanna know
Oh girl, I want to know, oh yes

You're looking for someone to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
'Cause I'm a big man now, girl
No, I'm not a boy, I'm not a boy, oh no
I'm not playing with toys, oh no

So girl, just tell me
What you are dealing with, I wanna know
Oh girl, just tell me what you are dealing with
I wanna know, I wanna know
Oh girl, I want to know, oh yes

We made arrangement to meet
Each other at the bus stop after school
And how you let me wait there
As if I'm fool, as if I'm fool
Oh yes, as if I'm fool, oh yes
