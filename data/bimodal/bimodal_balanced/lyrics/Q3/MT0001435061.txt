It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
Lord when I was in love with you darling, Long time I didn't love you

Just to make your own paycheck baby
Bring it all home to me
I go out every night baby
And I get all mad about girls I see

It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
Lord when I was in love with you darling, Long time I didn't love you

You used to stay home with me darling
Now you're going around with all the boys
You say you don't need me
Lord it's tough on my nerves

It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
Lord when I was in love with you darling, Long time I didn't love you

Oh I'm down on my knees
Can't think what tomorrow will bring
Lord I'm gonna try to do better baby
And love you the best I can

It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you want to do
Lord when I was in love with you darling, Long time I didn't love you
