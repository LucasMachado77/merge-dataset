The perfect words never crossed my mind
'Cause there was nothing in there but you

I felt every ounce of me
Screaming out
But the sound was trapped
Deep in me

All I've wanted just sped right past me
But I was rooted fast to the earth
I could be stuck here for a thousand years
Without your arms to drag me out

There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, standing right in front of me
Forced fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close
'Cause I need you to guide me to safety

No, I don't wanna wait forever
No, I don't wanna wait forever

In the confusion
And the aftermath
You are my signal fire

The only resolution
And the only joy
Is the faint spark of forgiveness
In your eye

There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, standing right in front of me
Forced fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close
'Cause I need you to guide me to safety

There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, standing right in front of me
Forced fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close
'Cause I need you to guide me to safety

No, I don't wanna wait forever
No, I don't wanna wait forever
No, I don't wanna wait forever
