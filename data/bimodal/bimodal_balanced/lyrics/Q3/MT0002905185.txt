I come all the way from Texas just to shake glad hands with you
I come all the way from Texas just to shake glad hands with you
Yes, but when I seed in your smiling face
I didn't know just what to do

I ought to been knowing these things for a great long time
I ought to been knowing these things for a great long time
You know it take me for quite awhile
Before I made it up in my mind

Got to play it a minute

I'm gonna tell all my friends just as soon as I go back home
I'm gonna tell all my friends just as soon as I go back home
Know they all gonna get on
And wonder what is I been waiting on
