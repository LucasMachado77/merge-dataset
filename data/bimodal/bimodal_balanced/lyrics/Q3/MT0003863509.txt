Lately life with you
Has been unbearable
All my faith in you has gone
And I know it won't return

I did everything to make you happy
I could do

Now you've gotten me hatin'
Things I used to love to do
And it won't be long
And I'll be hatin' you

Whatever happened to the love
That we once knew?
Was it jealousy
Or did you just grow tired
Of havin' me around you?

I did everything to make you happy
I could do
You've gotten me hatin'
Things I used to love to do
And it won't be long
And I'll be hatin' you

After the beatin' my heart has took
It should be black and blue
But you just won't admit
That we are through

Now you've gotten me hatin'
Things I used to love to do
And it won't be long
And I'll be hatin' you

It won't be long
And I'll be hatin' you
