Tell me pretty daddy, what's the matter now?
Tell me pretty daddy, what's the matter now?
Are you trying to quit me, and you don't know how

I'd rather be dead, buried in the sea
I'd rather be dead, buried in the sea
Than hear the man I love say he don't want me

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Oh the man I love treats me like a dog

I'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door, Lord, Lord
Rather see my coffin come rolling in my door
Than hear my daddy say "I don't want you no more"
