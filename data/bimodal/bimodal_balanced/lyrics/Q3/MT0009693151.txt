I believe in the only
We're supposed to be lonely
No wonder we're never alone
I've been watching the star signs
Recording my sight lines
From windows I shut to hide

I've been watching the air sleep
To see how the time slips past
The living keep falling away
So I stay in this watch tower
To wait for a safer hour
Enclosed in mortar and stone

The walls are starting to crack
How could they hold back?
The waves have always broken through
But, yeh, I needed proof, 'cos I have been lied to
These walls are all that I know

I can leave, I can leave, by my own mouth
Go ahead tear down this old doubt
The room's already outgrown
Just don't tell me what don't exist
Outside where the darkness is
When the ground starts trembling through
The walls are starting to crack
They couldn't hold back
These ways have always broken through
Yeh, I needed proof
'cos I have been lied to
These walls are all that I know
