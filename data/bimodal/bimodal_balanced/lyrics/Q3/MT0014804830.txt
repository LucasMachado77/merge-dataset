Strange stories pass around
Low voices speak so loud
I thought that I knew
Now I do

When there's a space in what you know
All kinds of thoughts appear
It's so easy to believe the worst
When it's all you hear
Now I know
Now I know
About you
Now I know

You were a mystery
No-one could help me solve
So I just had to see for myself
Now I know
Now I know
About you
Now I know

Strange stories pass around
Strange stories about you
Low voices speak so loud
I thought that I knew
Now I do

Close my eyes, close my ears
Nothing can hurt me
Now I know
No more doubts, no more fears
No more guessing
Now I know
