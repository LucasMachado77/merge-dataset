Lookin' back on the memory of
The dance we shared
Beneath the stars above

For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known
That you'd ever say goodbye?

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go

'Cause my life is better left to chance
I could've missed the pain
But I'd have to miss the dance
Holdin' you, I held everythin'
For a moment
Wasn't I the king?

If I'd only known
How the king would fall
Then who's to say you know
I might have changed it all

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go

'Cause my life is better left to chance
I could've missed the pain
But I'd have to miss the dance

Yes our lives are better left to chance
I could've missed the pain
But I'd have to miss the dance
