On the other side of the world is an island
The shape of a woman
And I know this place
From there, there is no escape

You know she held me
Not too tight for she would break me
Not too loose for I would slip away
To the other side of the world
You know she held me
Like I could leave at any time
And I could breathe into the wire
And tell myself I'm free

Then it turned under my feet
And buildings and the trees left with the wind
Left me standing
In a dirty city street, when I'm a stranger to everyone
And everyone is a stranger to me
If I could talk to you, darlin'
I'd tell you all the things I never said
Of how you hid those tears away from me
Like I couldn't hear
For I loved you through this wilderness
I loved you through the shit
I loved you through the best times that there ever was
From the other side of the world

Then it turned under my feet
And buildings and the trees left with the wind
Left me standing
Now I'm shouting at satellites
I'm screaming down the wires
To find you

On the other side of the world is an island
The shape of a woman
And I know this place
I know this place
