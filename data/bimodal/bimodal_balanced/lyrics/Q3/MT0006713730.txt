I met you in the saddle, I rode you in the dust
Held your hand to the heavens, pulled your heart to the earth
There was something that blinded me more than the mist
And the breath of the cottonwood buds lighter yet

When you rode the maypole of dance hall lace
And galloped to another's embrace
And I bit the flowers from my wrist corsage
You waltzed too slowly, too slowly, you waltzed
With that girl from Widow's Grove

Oh, I'd follow you to the river that washes out to the sea
Through the wind, through the rain of a cold dark night
That's where I'll be

Near the breath of a swallow, petals dropped as you fell
You grabbed me then shyly held me against the stone cold well
In your hand was a glass, you held the ice against the night
And it dripped and it sparkled and I laughed a wish
Before it all slipped down the dark tunneled well
I heard it melt quietly and I looked at you
Bent to the earth with one pleading wish
Your skirts brushed to the furious pounding

Oh I'd follow you to the river that washes out to the sea
Through the wind, through the rain of a cold dark night
That's where I'll be

I hid in the elm and raised the bough
That hung even with your neck
I chased you and drowned you there deep in the well
And when your mouth was full and wet
I swallowed all your reckless fate
And with your last breath
You moaned too drunk to wake

Oh, I followed you to the river that washes out to the sea
Through the wind, through the rain of a cold dark night
That's where I'll be
Through the wind, through the rain of a cold dark night
That's where I'll be
