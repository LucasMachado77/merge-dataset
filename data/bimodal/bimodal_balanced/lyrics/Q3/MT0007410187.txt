They say you never speak about me
Never even mention my name
And that you get along without me
I wish I could say the same

All that's left is just an ember
Gone is all the warmth of the flame
The dreams we shared, you don't remember
I wish I could say the same

How can I erase, the memory of your face
When your eyes come smilin' through
How can I dismiss, the memory of each kiss
When my heart remind me of you

To think that sweethearts now are strangers
That a change of heart was to blame
And so you don't regret these changes
I wish I could say the same

How can I erase, the memory of your face
When your eyes come smilin' through
How can I dismiss, the memory of each kiss
When my heart remind me of you
To think that sweethearts now are strangers
That a change of heart was to blame
And so you don't regret these changes
I wish I could say the same
