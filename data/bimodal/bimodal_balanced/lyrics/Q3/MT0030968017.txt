Last night you told me
That we were through
And all the time, I thought
That your love was true

You-ooo hurt me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go
You always told me
We'd never, ever part
But now you turn around
And break my loving heart

You hurt me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go

I'm beggin', please come back to me!
A life is now at stake
An' if you don't soon return
You're gonna drive me to my grave

You hurt me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go
Umm

I'm beggin', please come back to me!
A life is now at stake
If you don't soon return
You're gonna drive me to my grave

You hurt me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go

Ooh, you hurt me
You hurt me
You hurt me so

You know you hurt me
When you let me go
