They tell me love is like quicksand
And you can't stop when you're sinking down
They tell me love is like quicksand
And you can't stop when you're sinking down

My girl leave me down to destruction
You know I can't just turn around
She's a hard-hearted woman
And she always treat me wrong
She's a hard-hearted woman
And she always treat me wrong
She treat me so bad
That she makes me weap and moan
No joke

She's a hard-hearted woman
And she always treat me wrong
I'm going down, baby
'Cause you always treat me wrong
My hands are ripped in half, baby
So please, won't you listen to my moans?
