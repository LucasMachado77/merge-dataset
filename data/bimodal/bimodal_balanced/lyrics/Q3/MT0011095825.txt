Driving up the dust and smoke
Here comes drums, here comes the dust
Here comes retreat
The rescue

Here comes retreat, here comes escape
Dark ends
They're underground, creeping to the higher slopes of
Here comes the last, here comes exit

Cutting backwards, sticks and stones
The hit the signs, the undergrowth

Jumping walls day to day
Lose control it's sabotage

Reaching out the retreat
Here comes retreat, here comes rescue
Dug up dark ends, underground
Creeping to the highest slopes
Here comes the last, here comes exit

Cutting backwards, sticks and stones
The hidden signs, the undergrowth
Here comes exit, here comes escape

Jumping walls, day to day
While it's control, it's sabotage
Here comes action, here comes retreat

Dragging up the dust and smoke
Here comes the drum, here comes the dust

Reaching out, here comes the last
Here comes exit
Two dug up dark holes, dark ends
They're underground
Creeping to the higher slopes
Here comes the last, here comes rescue
