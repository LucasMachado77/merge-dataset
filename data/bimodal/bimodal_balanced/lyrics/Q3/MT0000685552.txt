Why you guys always teasing me
C'mon fellas just let me be
You never give me a moments rest
You guys are buggin' me to death
You know that girl would've done me wrong
Just keep on guys and it won't be long

You know I never do love her
I never could care about her
Please don't tease me about her
Cause now I don't think about her at all

Never held her in my arms very tight
Never loved with all my might
Never gave her my high school ring
Never bought her expensive things
I only gave her one ride in my car
And I didn't drive her very far

You know I never do love her
I never could care about her
Please don't tease me about her
Cause now I don't think about her at all

I took her home from school one day
Cause her house is on my way
She never gave me a reason why
She never gave me a reason to cry
Leave me alone just let me be
She's much to good for me to see
It just couldn't have worked
She was no good, no good
I never loved her
Get off my back
