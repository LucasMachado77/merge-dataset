You're a mean black spider and your web's all over town
You're a mean black spider and your web's all over town
I'm gonna get me a mean red spider that can tear your cobweb down

If I done going crazy, I would surely lose my mind
If I done going crazy, I would surely lose my mind
Because this mean black spider, she keeps my worried all the time

You remember the morning baby when I first came in your town
You got me in your cobweb and you tied me down
Don't you remember, when I first came in your town
You got me in your cobweb and you know you tied me down

My breaks are not coming, there's no need for you to moan
My breaks are not coming, there's no need for you to moan
This mean red spider, is going to take your happy home
