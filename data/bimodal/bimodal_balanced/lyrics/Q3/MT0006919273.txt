She planted roses, the first year we married
It soon was a garden we'd go walking through
My job kept me travlin', but when I came home to heaven
She was so proud to show me all the love that she grew

I heard her talking, one day to a old friend
She said I don't want to hurt him, but it's out of control
I feel so guilty 'cause he'll be so helpless
He won't understand why I just got to go

Now I come to the garden alone
All my reasons I once had for livin' are gone
Sometimes when I feel like I just can't go on
I come to the garden alone

No one can imagine just how much I miss her
I'd give up this whole world to once more hold her near
It's just beyond me why God took her from me
I'll bet the flowers in heaven are lookin' better this year

Now I come to the garden alone
Where the dew kissed the roses, the weeds now have grown
Sometimes when I feel like I just can't go on
I come to the garden alone

Oh, I come to the garden alone
