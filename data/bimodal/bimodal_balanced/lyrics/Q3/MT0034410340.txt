Yes I rolled, baby.
Rolled all night long.
Lord, I rolled this mornin'.
Didn't know right from wrong.

Lord, I know my baby.
She gonna jump an shout.
Lord, I know my little woman.
She gonna jump an shout.
When my train roll up.
And I'll come walkin' out.

Been a long time! 

Lord, I know my baby.
She gonna jump an shout.
Lord, I know my little woman.
She gonna jump an shout.
When my train roll up.
And I'll come walkin' out.

And you never blow the whistle.
And no fireman rung the bell.
And you never blow the whistle.
And no fireman rung the bell.
Lord, I didn't have time.
Lord, I didn't have time.
Tell my baby, fare you well.
