You paint walls and buildings so tall
Sunlight never reaches the earth

A birth as the paint covers cracks
And stains, and nothing remains
No, nothing remains

But a new face so pale and white
Sunlight makes it shrink

And think that maybe the womb
Sings a better tune
Sings a better tune

And the mind-bending heat of blistering streets
And air so polluted
That every breath is a curse

You paint walls and buildings so tall
That sunlight never reaches earth

But the sound of crying
Still will reach your ears
Still will reach your ears
