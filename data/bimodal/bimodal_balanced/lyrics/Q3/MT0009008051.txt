Sittin' restless under the moonlight
I know I'm gettin' ready to kill
They say we're goin' in with the daylight
Ma I don't want to but I will

'Cause I don't know the man that kills me
And I don't know these men I kill
I pray to God for my salvation
Wash away the blood I spilled

I try not to think about my family
'Cause it's a little too much to take
Out here I got me and I got my buddy
We can't afford even one mistake

Sorry about writin' on dirty cardboard
It's the only paper that I could find
Tell everyone I got their letters
Tell everyone I'm doin' fine

Late at night when I can dream, Ma
I think about life back in the world
I miss you and Dad, I miss sister Sarah
I miss my wife and my baby girl

Pray for me, pray for my soul, Ma
Pray for me and all my sins
They say that I got a job to do now
And I'll be back when it finally ends

Do you think I should be fighting?
Ma are you proud, are you ashamed
Really I'm tryin' to do the right thing
I hope my government can say the same

'Cause I won't know the man that kills me
And I don't know these men I kill
We all wind up on the same side
'Cause ain't none of us doin' God's will
