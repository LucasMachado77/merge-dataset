She's like a frostfern in my head
The lamplight burns my eyes and then she fades away
My pencil's frozen in my hand
And the letter I can't write, it seems to be a desert without end
I woke up late at night
She called me up, then disappeared
And the echo of her voice
Filled the empty places in my dreams
With the silent tide

She fades away
Again
Oo, she fades away
She fades away again
Don't go now
Please stay

My senses cruising through a void
As pale reflections play on the deserted road
I hear the humming of machines
A distant sound like thunder
Crawling through the cold
There's no escape, I know
I run around in circles without end
And the more the memory grows
Dissolving from reality
With the silent tide

She fades away
Again
Oo, she fades away
She fades away again
Don't go now
Please stay

Don't make me cry

This time
I've got to learn
I know
She won't return
This time
I've got to learn
I know
She won't return
This time I've got to learn
I know she won't return
This time I've got to learn
I know she won't return
This time I've got to learn
I know she won't return
This time I've got to learn
I know she won't return
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
This time I've got to learn
I know she won't return
This time I've got to learn
I know she won't return
Don't make me, don't make me cry
