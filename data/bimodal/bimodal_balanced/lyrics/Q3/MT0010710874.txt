Come here, pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee
Come here, pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee
I just want to tell you how you have mistreated me

You leave me after supper and you don't come home 'til morn
You leave me after supper and you don't come home 'til morn
You'll come home some morning and find your cherry tree gone

You can slip back to your brownskin, I mean your used-to-be
You can slip back to your brownskin, I mean your used-to-be
I know you're crazy 'bout your cherry pie, but you can't two-time me

I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town
I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town
Goodbye, pretty papa, another man has cut your cherry tree down
