I found your bag this morning
Did you pack it by yourself
If you would've asked me
I'd have given you some help

I hate to disappoint you
But I had a hunch
You would soon be leaving
So I beat you to the punch

I'll tell you a secret, baby, I let go first
If I was still holding on, then maybe I'd feel worse
But I seen this day coming, so it don't bother me
I've already set you free
I'm glad you're finally going
But, boy, you took your time
I'd begun to wonder
If you had changed your mind

So you don't have to sneak out
You're not going to let me down
That's already happened
I'm over it by now

I'll tell you a secret, baby, I let go first
If I was still holding on, then maybe I'd feel worse
But I seen this day coming, so it don't bother me
I've already set you free
I've already set you free
