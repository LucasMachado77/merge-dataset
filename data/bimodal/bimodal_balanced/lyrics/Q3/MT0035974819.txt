 heard that song on the radio
The one you sang to by the rolling stones
Guess I always thought we'd ride those wild horses

We were happy getting no-where fast
Hand out the window and my feet on the dash
Sometimes I think still think you're sitting right beside me
And we were king and queen of the rock and roll scene

Baby I can't stop thinking, my heart keeps breaking, I'm paralysed
I wish I could stop this missing, get over your kissing, and realise
That the hardest part of trying to say goodbye is you by her side

Tonight I walked into our favourite bar
A glass of whiskey and a steel guitar
There you were slow dancing a long fandango

I thought that I would introduce myself
I'd be a hero, I'd be somebody else
But sometimes it's just easier to walk away
But she was holding on like you were all alone

Oh Baby I can't stop thinking, my heart keeps breaking, I'm paralysed
I wish I could stop this missing, get over your kissing, and realise
That the hardest part of trying to say goodbye is you by her side

Oh Oh, I'm tryin't' be fine
Oh oh still feels like you're mine, it feels like you're mine

Oh Baby I can't stop thinking, my heart keeps breaking, I'm paralysed
I wish I could stop this missing, get over your kissing, and realise
That the hardest part of trying to say goodbye

Oh the hardest part of trying to say goodbye is you by her side
You by her side
