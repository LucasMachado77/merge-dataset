Last night I lost the best friend I'll ever have
Last night I lost the best friend I'll ever have
You know I went in to talk to poor mother about it
She said, "Son, that's too black bad" (?)

She said, "That's a warning to you
You should fall down on you knees and pray"
She said "That's a warning, that is a warning to you, son
You should fall down on your knees and pray"
She said, "you should ask the good lord to forgive you
For be living this old reckless way"

And I holler (unintelligible)

Every morning, I'm talking about the break of day
Early morning, I'm talking about the break of day
You know that's when I looks over on the pillow
Where that little girl, she used to lay
I call her, but she couldn't answer me
