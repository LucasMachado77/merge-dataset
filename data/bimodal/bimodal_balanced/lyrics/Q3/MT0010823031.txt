Hello, skid row

Will you make reservations for me?
Hello, skid row
Will you make reservations for me?
I got pressures of a millionaire
I drink so much I don't care
But when I wake up it still remains
And I just can't stand this pain

Skid row, skid row
Look for me down there soon
Skid row, skid row
Look for me down there soon

I got house note
Car note
Gas bill, light bill
Drink so much they disappear
But when I wake up
It still remains
I tell you I can't
Stand this pain

Skid row
Skid row

Skid row
Skid row
Best friend I've ever known
Skid row
Skid row
The best friend I've ever known
All these things I'm going to lose
Revenue got the singing blues
It happened so fast I can't explain
I tell you I just can't stand this pain

Skid row, skid row
Look for me down there soon
Skid row, skid row
Look for me down there soon

I got a lot of friends down there
It seems they don't have a care
You rescued them from misery
Won't you do the same for me?

Skid row
Skid row
Make reservations for me

Skid row
Skid row

I know I'll be down there soon
Look for me at skid row
You rescued a lot of my friends
And I want you to do the same
The same for me
That's why I called on you, skid row
