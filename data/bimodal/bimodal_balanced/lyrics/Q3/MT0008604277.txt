Some people see wrong in everything
In books that we read, in the songs that we sing
Some people just look for the dark side of life
They thrive on suspicion, sorrow and strife

Some people will see some wrong in our love
But we only answer to God up above
And we have our conscious to live with each day
So why should we care what some people say
