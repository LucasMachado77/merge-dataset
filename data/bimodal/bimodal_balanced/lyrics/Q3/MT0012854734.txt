A violet fell in love with a rose
And started it flashing from its head to its toe
Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew
A new love was born and the violet turned blue.

Roses are red, violets are blue
I'm sending red red roses to you
If you care to send some flowers to me
Then send me some violets, I'm blue as can be.

I wanted my love to bouquet with you
But just like the rose you've proven untrue
A flower that's wild they say has no home
And just like the violet I'm left all alone.

Roses are red, violets are blue
I'm sending red red roses to you
If you care to send some flowers to me
Then send me some violets, I'm blue as can be...
