I thought I had me a woman
A woman that would be true
I thought that after I married
Her love would always be true

But the first thing I knew
When my back was turned
Got my ever loving fingers burned

Well, I came home
One evening from work
I'm just a lowly grocery clerk

My woman thinks that
I should be more
Thinks I should own
That whole darn store

Don't trust a yellow haired woman
Don't trust her if her hair is brown
Don't trust any kind of woman
She'll always let you down

And the first thing you knew
When your back is turned
Get your ever loving fingers burned

I thought I had me a woman
A woman that would be true
I thought that if I married
Her love would always be true

But the first thing I knew
When my back was turned
Got my ever loving fingers burned
