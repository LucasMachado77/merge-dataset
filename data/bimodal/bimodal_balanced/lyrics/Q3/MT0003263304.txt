Is it news?
When you say you got something to say
Well I've heard it already today
I don't think so
I't ain't news

Is it true?
When you say your home by yourself
My eyes saw you with someone else
I don't think so
You ain't true

Are we through?
Could this really be the time?
That I walk out and I don't mind
Have we wasted all our time?
Is it news?
When you say you got something to say
Well I've heard it already today
I don't think so
I't ain't news

Have we wasted all out time?
Is it new?
Is it new?
I hear it all
I heard it all before
I don't think it's news
Do you really have something to say?

Is it news?
When you say you got something to say
Well I've heard it already today
I don't think so
I't ain't news

Is it new?
When you say you got something to say
Well I've heard it already today
I don't think so
