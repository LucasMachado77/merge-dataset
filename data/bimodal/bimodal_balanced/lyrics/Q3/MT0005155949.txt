Once you said you loved me
Placed no one above me
Prayed for me to make that vow
What dumb thing did I say
So busy being blas√©
How I wish you'd ask me now

I was vain and blind then
Prone to be unkind then
Wish they'd turn back time somehow
Then I was audacious
I ignored what was precious
How I wish you'd ask me now

I thought then I'd always be
Footloose and fancy free
How could I have been so blind
What I once made light of
Turn out to be true love

Once my ego ruled me
Flattered me and fooled me
More times than the laws allow
You asked me could I care
My attention was elsewhere
How I wish you'd ask me now

You asked me could I care
My attention was elsewhere
How I wish you'd ask me now
