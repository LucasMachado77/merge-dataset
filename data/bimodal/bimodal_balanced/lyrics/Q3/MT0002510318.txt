Down from my ceiling drips great noise
It drips on my head through a hole in the roof
Behind these two hills here, there's a pool
And when I'm swimming in through a tunnel, I shut my eyes

Inside their cabin, I make sound
In through the tubes, I send this noise
Behind these two hills here, fall asleep
And when I float in green grass of tunnel, it flows back
Behind these two hills here, fall asleep
And when I float in green grass of tunnel, it flows back

Down from the ceiling drips great noise
It drips on my head through a hole in the roof
Behind these two hills here, there's a pool
And when I'm swimming in through a tunnel, I shut my eyes
