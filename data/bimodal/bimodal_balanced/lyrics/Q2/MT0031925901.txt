They won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen
They won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen
They won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen
They won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen, they won't fucking listen

We know our know our enemy they're hiding underground
They want us to live and die in the shit they leave around
What can we do? What can we say?
We're not dead yet; to show we're alive?
The government says "shove it" and "don't get in the way"
But we're sliding down corpses on a world nose-dive
People here cling tightly to their fear and their fun
The dead are abroad, so our streets are clean
Even those who know, hide in Sounds and Sun
What will it take to stop the machine?

It's only when we're serious and start to make fuss
That the politicians show their real face
It's the copper and the squaddy who were once one of us
Now trained to do the dirty work and know their place
If they won't listen either, what can we do?
They're people. Yes. But only people oppress
If we can go round them, we'll have to go through
If it rains and there's no shelter we must work in the mess

They say they're only trying to uphold the law
And if they were off duty we could talk some more
O.K., they're individuals but when they're in a mob
They're under orders, it's a dirty job
The plods are taught to go for your neck
Or bust your nose running their gauntlet
P.C. Punishment on the spot
Take the law into their own hands and fuck us a lot
If we choose to leave the paths that we've been taught
Don't expect help, do don't get caught

They try so very hard to seem reasonable and straight
And asked you twice already to co-operate
"You have every right to protest like anyone these days
But keep to the footpath and out the fucking way, see?"

If we choose to leave the paths that we've been taught
Don't expect help, do don't get caught

They'll think it's easy on the news at ten
The commie-anar-fems are at it again
Annoying the police and the passive 'grass roots'
We're living in a country where the army shoots
People with courage dumped and stranded
Don'ts and won'ts look on empty-handed
If you fuck up the state, don't be a star
They're struck if they don't know who you are

If we choose to leave the paths that we've been taught
Don't expect help, do don't get caught

To stand up for the good of all and make demands for peace
Will bring us hard and sharp against the army and police
Well, they're the poor too, just like us, maybe it's too late
The rich are in their bunker, the poor are at the gate
Use our head to avoid confrontation
Our love to avoid exploitation
If the uniforms choose to stay
They'll have to learn to get out of the fucking way
If we choose to leave the paths that we've been taught
We cease to be the seeker, we become the sought
