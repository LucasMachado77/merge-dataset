I am living in a foreign country
And everything about it bugs me, bugs me
Everywhere I turn it's the same old story
Narrow-minded fools that bore me, bore me

I've been told so many times
To love it or leave it, it's the same old line
But nothing is half as sick as this
Patriotic, idiotic fucking piss
I am the establishment
By divine guidance I've been sent
You will ignore the president
'Cause I am the establishment

Well fascists, I've got news for you
I was fucking born here too
And I'm not gonna tolerate
Your violence, bigotry, and hate
I am the establishment
By divine guidance I've been sent
You will ignore the president
'Cause I am the establishment
I am the establishment
I AM THE ESTABLISHMENT!!
