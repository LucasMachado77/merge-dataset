Sick of all these dumb solutions

Why not tell me something new?
I've been hearing so much bullshit
It's impossible to tell the truth
How can they preach all their morals
When they're worse than we'll ever be?
We're a useless threat to their walls of silence
But there's no solution to convince me

You can scream-shout-fight the system
But it won't fight back...
Safe behind their walls of silence

The system stinks and we all know it
But the mass protesters get nowhere
A wall of arms against a wall of silence
They just pretend that we're not there
And there's nothing we can do about it
Fighting each other all day long
Divide ourselves by petty ritual
Then we wonder what went wrong
