Don't tell me you're helpless
Nothing makes a difference
Attitudes do change a thing
Their's more to life than living
You live, you die, you wounder why?
Most people will make the time
You dream, you hopes, you just can cope
With the life that you can't understand

I'm sick of all the bitterness
I'm sick of all the hate
Everyone's so disconnected
No one can communicate

How can - how can - how can we live like this?
How can - how can - how can we live like this?
