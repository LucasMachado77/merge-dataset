One, two, three, four!

Get away from the window!
The D.S. are outside
The little packets in our pockets
Stuff we gotta hide
Sitting in a corner of a disco
My mouth stuck in a bag
It's hard to fake the high intake
It turns your brain real bad

It's drugs of youth!
Get drugs of youth!
Get drugs of youth!

Crush a barb put it in a syringe
Stick it in your arm
Let the feeling crawl your head
It won't do you no harm
Sniffing sulfate up my nose
Doing it for a joke
It makes the world spin so fast
Things go better with coke

It's drugs of youth!
Get drugs of youth!
Get drugs of youth!

In your butt!
Get drugs of youth!
Get drugs of youth!
Get drugs of youth!


Give me a fag, ?, glue, ?, pills
Give me a thrill
Give me headache
Let me lie on the ground
Drugs of youth!
