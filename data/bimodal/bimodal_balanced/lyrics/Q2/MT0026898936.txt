Well, I think that I'm through with the girl I thought I knew
But I guess I didn't know her well at all
'Cause I'm getting sick of Janie's latest kick
She's headed for her own decline and fall

Janie took a razor blade and cut off all her hair
Had swastikas and iron crosses tattooed everywhere
And she can't concentrate on anything but hate
And she's out of control
I used to think I loved that girl but now I just don't know
'Cause she's a nazi, nazi
(nazi girl)
Janie is a nazi, nazi
(nazi girl)
Janie is a nazi, nazi
(nazi girl)
And I don't think I can take it anymore

Well, she still looks cute when she wears her leather boots
But now she wants to put them through your skull
And I miss the way things were
'Cause I ain't bangin' her
I'm just bangin' my head against the wall

Janie took a razor blade and cut off all her hair
Had swastikas and iron crosses tattooed everywhere
And she can't concentrate on anything but hate
And she's out of control
I used to think I loved that girl but now I just don't know
'Cause she's a nazi, nazi
(nazi girl)
Janie is a nazi, nazi
(nazi girl)
Janie is a nazi, nazi
(nazi girl)
And I don't think I can take it anymore

No!
