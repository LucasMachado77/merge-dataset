As I walk beneath the valley, I shall fear no evil
For thanks to king George and his rainbow cabinet
Today murder is legal, God I know that it's wrong
To kill my brother for what he hasn't done

And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is falling
It sounds like heaven is falling
You promised me a new day dawning

I've seen a thousand points of light
Like so many points of hatred, shame and horror
God I want to be a man
But I don't want to die with a rifle in my hand

And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is falling
It sounds like heaven is falling
You promised me a new day dawning

Well, nothing here looks new to me
But a score of mothers' sons
Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
