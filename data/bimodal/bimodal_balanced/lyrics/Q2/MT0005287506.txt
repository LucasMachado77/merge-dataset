Despise the shallow minds that never heard of empathy
Despise to the bone, their lives is a comedy
With fancy shoes and a nice black tie
They get more, more, more as our lives go buy

It's getting to me

I've got this empty feeling inside of my head
I put myself to sleep but I wish I was dead
I see these motherfuckers but they don't look me in the eye
And as they're getting more my day passes by

Well that's my fate!
And it's getting to me!

Despise the shallow minds that never heard of empathy
Despise to the bone, their lives is a comedy
With fancy shoes and a nice black tie
They get more, more, more as our lives go buy

It's getting to me

Well that's my fate!
And it's getting to me!
