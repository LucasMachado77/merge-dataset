When you hear those voices coming in loud and clear pay heed
Take your time before you step
To change your world it only takes one split second so -
Watch your step before you leap

It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt
It's all fun and games till sorrow
It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt
It's all fun and games

I'm not a fucking joke
She's playing with my head
Tearing at my heart
She's been a messin' Jas(on)

I've been afraid to raid her because I find
I need a last chance blast to make a bust out of here
I need to find and appreciate with my head
I need a chance just to get this straight

When you cheated
Then you lied
When you cheated
It's a fuckin' joke

When you cheated
Then you lied
When you cheated

There may come a time when you just might not think it's worth it
But try to think twelve hours ahead
When the only thing in mind is the girl in your head well
A girl like that is hard to find

It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt
It's all fun and games till sorrow
It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt
It's all fun and games

I'm not a fucking joke
She's playing with my head
Tearing at my heart
She's been a messin' Jas(on)

I've been afraid to raid her because I find
I need a last chance blast to make a bust out of here
I need to find and appreciate with my head
I need a chance just to get this straight

When you cheated
Then you lied
When you cheated
It's a fuckin' joke

When you cheated
Then you lied
When you cheated
It's a fuckin' joke
