I can't see smoke hanging like a noose in the sky
I can't see death lurking, only you and I
We're small cogs in a big machine
Wake up son cause it's no dream

Go....
Wake up the whole worlds gone
Wake up the whole worlds gone
Wake up the whole worlds gone..
.. Gone limpwristed

Genders, bend over for me
Nothing can hide your bland puppetry
We ain't got your elegant grace
Got gravel in our guts and spit in your face
Do you really believe you can corrupt the youth?
Credit them with more, they know the truth
Stay out of the way, don't keep in touch
Cause reality hurts like a kick in the crotch
