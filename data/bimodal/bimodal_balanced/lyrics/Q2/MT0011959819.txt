Some say you're choosing to fight
And some say you're scheduled to live or die
Some say you're scheduled to kill
Laughing at what they will do

What if they are right
To lift the fate of everyone
Let them live in pain
A pain to which there is no end

As I look to the right
I see the horror filled within
Killing is the meaning of life
Killing is a way to leave your body

A mean to release your fear
A fear of sickness deep within
Let the guilty pay
A pain to which there is no end

Back from the grave
I took the life of everyone
From the bottom of the grave
I took the death of everyone

To those who fear their right
You are the first sight then filled with fear
A fear that begins to mount
The fear that turns you inside out
Into the realms of no way out
Into a life of the utter doubt
A place in which you won't exist
A place in which you're living dead
