Lying in bed, trying to stay quiet
Clasp your lips together, ride this forever
I'm holding on tight, letting out a sigh
Don't ever let go, don't open your eyes
Breathe deeper, deeper
Oh, I've never felt better than-

Oh, I'm holding on for you...
Let's finish this together
Have you ever done something that makes you proud?
On and on, I do it hands down
I... I wanna have a good time

Hearts are beating faster, and nothing could be hotter
I see you getting closer, Amity
Your breath is getting shorter
My arms are tired
You're slowly sliding closer...
To me
Oh, I'm holding on for you...
Let's finish this together
Have you ever done something that makes you proud?
On and on, I do it hands down
I... I wanna have a good time

Hold on just a second longer, baby
Hold on, feeling like we'll both get lucky
Hold on, this will all be worth it, baby
Hold on...

Oh, I'm holding on for you...
Let's finish this together
Have you ever done something that makes you proud?
On and on, I do it hands down
I... I wanna have a good time
