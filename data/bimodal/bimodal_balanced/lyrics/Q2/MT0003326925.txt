Friendship
To you it means nothing
Time and time again
You betray friends With lies
And your gossip
The stories you tell
Can hurt like hell!

It's your big mouth
And it's getting on my nerves
You know I wish you'd just shut it up
It's your big mouth
And the shit that comes out
Has nothing to do with
What you're talking about

You know I want to trust you but I can't
Your word's not given, it's lent
My advice to you
Is to start somewhere
Why don't you shut the fuck up now

It's your big mouth
And it's getting on my nerves
You know I wish you'd just shut it up
It's your big mouth
And the shit that comes out
Has nothing to do
With what you're talking about
