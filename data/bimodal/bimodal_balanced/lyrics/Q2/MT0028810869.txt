Can't stand the way you look
Can't stand the way you talk
Can't stand the way you act
Can't stand you

Do I think you're a dick? Yes
Do I think you're fat? Yes
Do I think we'll fight? Yes
Do you think you'll win? No
Do I think you're stupid? Yes
Do I think you're lame? Yes
Am I stressing?
You're the one to blame

Can't stand the way you look
Can't stand the way you talk
Can't stand the way you act
Can't stand you

Do I think you're shit? Yes
Do I think you're a fuck? Yes
Do I think we'll fight? Yes
Do you think you'll win? No
Do I think you're stupid? Yes
Do I think you're lame? Yes
Am I stressing?
You're the one to blame

I open my mouth at the wrong time
Always ragging on somebody
I'm drunk all the time
Throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face
Checking through the purse
Of the slut in your place

She'll never notice
If her money is gone
Piss in her jacket
And just send her along

Can't stand the way you look
Can't stand the way you talk
Can't stand the way you are
Can't stand you

Do I think you're sick? Yes
Do I think you're a fuck? Yes
Do I think we'll fight? Yes
Do you think you'll win? No
Do I think you're stupid? Yes
Do I think you're lame? Yes
Am I stressing?
You're the one to blame
