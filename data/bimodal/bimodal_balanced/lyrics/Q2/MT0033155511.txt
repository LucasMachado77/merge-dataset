Victims burn in the atmosphere
Breaking our back to get down here
I took a hand on a switcher?
Trying to run, keep your hands off
No one's better at doin' my work
Make me feel like dirt
You cross the line, took my freak-show
How the hell was I to know

Take the flowers out of night-sticks
Don't break nothing you can't fix
Pull the body beneath my face
Probably something you can't fix
Someone circling someone's eye
Pulled the wings off a butterfly
Take the handle into reverse
Just like you did it on purpose

Everybody is faceless
Stone cold and stateless
Form? a line to redemption
To re-increase the tension
Grab a gun while they're still hot
Well if you like it or not
Dream a negative dream for me
Adjust a hand over free
