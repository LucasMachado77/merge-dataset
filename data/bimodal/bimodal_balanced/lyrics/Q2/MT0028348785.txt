Waking from another nightmare
It's so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell

I can - see what's happening
I know - almost everything
I can tell - when I'm imagining
Why can't I - remember anything?

Waking from another nightmare
It's so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell

I'm told - I'm a psycopath
????? - I'll be in a paper ?????
Killing - somehow clears my mind
Willing - to do a little more each time

Waking from another nightmare
It's so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell

Never knowing if I'm really in reality
Never can tell if I am still asleep
Never knowing if I'm really in reality
Never can tell if I am still asleep

Never knowing if I need to - blame
Never to feel remorse or - shame
I never can remember what I do
I can't stop coming after you

Waking from another nightmare
It's so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell

Waking from another nightmare
It's so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell
