I'm so fucked up!

Let's have a party at my place and have way too much to drink
(So fucked up!)
We'll mix lunch with Everclear punch, and we can throw up in the sink
(So fucked up!)

And all I need is a reason, just gimme some excuse
'Cause all I need is a reason and a substance to abuse

And I'm so fucked up that I can't see
So fucked up that I can't think
So fucked up, so what'll it be?
'Cause we've got it all . . . drink, drink, drink!

Cheap scotch and drive-in food made an asshole outta me
(So fucked up!)
It was almost dawn I did a technicolor yawn on the hood of my dad's MG
(So fucked up!)

And all I need is a reason, just gimme some excuse
'Cause all I need is a reason and a substance to abuse

And I'm so fucked up that I can't speak
So fucked up and sick to boot
So fucked up, my stomach's weak
So where's the john . . . puke, puke, puke!
And all I need is a reason, just gimme some excuse
'Cause all I need is a reason and a substance to abuse

And I'm so fucked, my guts are churnin'
So fucked up, my heart has sunk
So fucked up, my head is burnin'
But I can't stop . . . drink, drank, drunk!
