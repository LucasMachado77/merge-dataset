Ya know we need a little crisis
To prove our sacrifices
Get the taboos lifted
Get the gears shifted

Don't get caught in the crossfire
Don't sabotage yourself trying to get higher
This whole situation is getting out of hand
Don't get caught in the crossfire
Don't sabotage yourself trying to get higher
Every outpost has roots into the land

We think that we're barbarians
But we feel more like titarians
Scared of our emotion
Causing a commotion

This could be explosive
Hunting without a motive
I ain't no super-structure
I'm flesh and bone, I fracture
