It ain't hard to tell
Don't think so
Can't ever deny when it's in your face
Don't get too scared and try to run away
It's everywhere you're ever gonna be
I'd like to share just a little bit
Just so you know what to look out for
Don't get too scared and try to run away
Cause it's here and it's there
Don't admit it
Don't waste it when you get it
That's the shit
You gotta feel it
I'm not here to sell
Don't think so I live and die
No attention to fate
I don't get too scared and try to run away
I realize how good it's gonna be
Id really like to share just a little bit
Just so you know what to look out for
Don't get too scared and try to run away
It's here, it's there
