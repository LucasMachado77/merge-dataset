Lay waste, torn asunder
Weak and lost in the past
Weak and lost in the past
Obfuscates the self mind
Ripped it away

Cobwebs and motes
In the eye of the sun god
I think not
Serpent get thee behind me
Eradicated your somnambulant enigma
This field has lain fallow
Won't erode, won't soak up the sediment
From your poisoned mind

No, I won't soak up your misery
Won't soak up your weakness
Won't soak up your banality
Taste vanadium
Wide awake realizing what you've done
Taste the frost
You chose your own death
You know that you choose well
I hate myself but not as much as I hate you
Tear yourself down
