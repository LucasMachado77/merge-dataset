Broke the line
Somewhere between these walls is a place I can hide out
Some other time
These empty scenes will feel like home

Just another lie
Another chance to kill any hope in a promise
Maybe tonight
I'll find it easier to fall

I know
These thoughts
Are best left alone
For now we'll live
For now we'll wish on better days

I broke this down
I'll build this up
I'll set the ground on second chance
A chance long gone
A chance I passed
More than once

I broke the line
Somewhere between these walls is the place I've been hiding
Another time
These empty scenes will feel like home
I know
These thoughts
Are best left alone
For now we'll live
For now we'll wish on better days

I broke this down
I'll build this up
I'll set the ground on second chance
A chance long gone
A chance I passed
More than once

At passing glance it's hard to see the damage done (we broke it all)
There's hope resting on the only thing that's left (what matters most)
This settled air gets thicker every moment I'm not breathing

I broke this down
I'll build this up
I'll set the ground on second chance
A chance long gone
A chance I passed
More than once
