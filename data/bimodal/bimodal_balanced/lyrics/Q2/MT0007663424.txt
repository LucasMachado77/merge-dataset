Your child is dead and gone tomorrow
You blame yourself, child is dead now
Murder, aggression, sexual perversion
You don't give a fuck about the children that you fucked

Serial killer going to get you
Watch out
Serial killer going to get you

I go home and watch what I did on the telly
It makes me cry just like a baby
This is not a sex act I can tell you
Children cry, pedophile, fuck you

Serial killer going to get you
Watch out
Serial killer going to get you

Come take a step in the future baby
Come see what life's all about tonight
Are you ready for life's adventure
Never know what you'll find out tonight

Serial killer going to get you
Watch out
Serial killer going to get you
