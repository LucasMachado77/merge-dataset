Sit down in the carousel
Up front like a brave boy
Don't scream like a little girl
Shut up boys don't cry

Come to a rest that flows
From a spring unseen
Cause honestly you're scaring me

Keep up with the schedule
Shape up, have to perform
Hold out for everyone
Don't fail, not now

Come to a rest that flows
From a spring unseen
Cause honestly you're scaring me

Failure is not a option
Have to keep on trying

So much to live up to
So many expectations
Trying so hard to be approved
A straight A student with yet another F
Oh no gotta make daddy proud now
Come to a rest that flows
From a spring unseen
Cause honestly you're scaring me

Failure is not an option
Have to keep on trying
So much pressure
Can't take this no more
The cause of death:
Suicide
