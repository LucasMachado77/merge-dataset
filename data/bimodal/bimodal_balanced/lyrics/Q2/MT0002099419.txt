"Took a Lear jet, don't fear yet"

"Took a Lear jet, don't fear yet"

And my bags is at the door

Where we're goin it's kinda cold
I'ma go and kiss my momma and my Grand Old Earth goodbye

Is there anything I'm forgettin?
Let me check my room, oh yeah there goes my boom

Not like a banana, where we're goin to Savannah
Heartland of Georgia, Florida, or Peoria
Yo I think here and now know downstairs y'knahmsayin?
We gonna come get you, head on over to the airport

That Brand Nubian do daily shows
Up in the Carolina NORTH, Carolina SOUTH
I kick the visit, in Richmond, lost in Boston
Benz in Houston, two hours away from Austin

Just low cars that bounce

We need our meals kosher on this flight
Don't want no swine in my sight

The kid's sendin a limo, to meet us at the gate

That motherfucker that time sent a fuckin ham sandwich

With knockin out trips like at six hour clips
Up in the Cali in the mornin groundstandin
BAGGAGE CLAIM AND OUR BAGGAGE WE'RE DEMANDIN

Feelin like crap, take a nap from the jet lag
WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UP
For the soundcheck.. before we GETS wreck
Now before the show, we gotta have a buddha fest
Call every brother's room so we can hit the buddha bless
Spark a L, here we go, SPARK ANOTHER L
Time for the show yo, and now we're feelin kinda swell

Man if we don't have that shit, then shoot

Dreads on stage combine with baldhead kids
Now I'm the Hey-Baby man who gets his drinks ?
Major in History (defeatin all the mystery)
I would think it's plain to see

Did you leave the hoe with a story to tell?

Dependin on the mental and the body that she's got

But uhh, let's pack up these bags
And get the fuck outta Dodge, word to mother
