Life - I was a lonely man
With my lead boots nailed to the floor
Dancing the best that I can
Sweets-took the pain away
I saw a cold death at the end of the line
So I started to pray

Up towards the sky but knew no one would answer me
I asked the trees why they grew toward the sun
I asked the clouds and they rained down bad luck on me
Oh my god, oh why has thou forsaken me

I asked the teachers who taught me rules to obey
I asked the sages and prophets through time
Came up nothing but a hole where my faith had laid
No reason, no rite... nothing feels fine tonight

Crime, it was a price to pay
I found the hole world as guilty as I
It took the danger away
Hate - it was so easy to do
You just directed all your anger at fear
And then you follow it through

I went to churches and schools to decide for me
I went to prophets to plea for my life
Went to my parents who gave this dark life to me
Oh my god, oh why has thou forsaken me
I don't need to
I don't want to
I don't want to wonder why
If you don't want to hear my problems
Well you can fuck off and die

You do not know. Dont say you know
Give me some answers for my life...

Now! Got some explaining to do
I've got to come up with solutions in time
Before my future is through
Hope - for my new promise today
Still I got this strange feeling that time is slowly slipping away

Slipping away
