Want to take a chance want to wait but it burns
Cut me what you want, but give me just a little more
I already know how it's going to feel to let you go
Cough me aside, put me out like a cigarette

But I won't forget
I'm not dead
I'm not fine
Feed me lies

All of this time spent sitting in my room trying to match with the faceless blood
Cut me what you want but you give me just a little bit more
I'm running out of words to say up here
I'm running out of words so listen up cause here I go

1, 2, 3, 4, 5
I'm not dead
I'm not alive
Feed me truth
Kill my friends
Unless they do
What I say
I need silence
I need addiction
I need a reason for my sins before I die

I'm not dead
Tell me lies
Feed me truth
Come on baby please be true
So I put
Cigarettes
In my eyes
