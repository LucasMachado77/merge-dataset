Weeding
Close cropped feeding
Drag me down
Dirt-stained ceiling

I'm pulling roots in places that pull down
I leach their naive faces, I'm past proud

Why do you follow through
All the weeds they follow you
Chasing down underground
Fencing in what you have found
Out of mind, out of sight
Passing judgement every night
All the weeds they follow you

Overripe

Clutching
Reach for nothing
Empty chair
Swelling
All their yelling
I don't care
I don't care
You bear witness to the expanse of my roots
As I twist and tangle towards you
Lost in the piercing power of my stare
You know that I'm your type
And as my fruit explodes upon you know I'm overripe
