Creation imperfect
Do you defy this?

Could you and
your swollen
ego fit
into my
master plan
for failure?

I take the shame to heart
and lock it away in a place thats sees not the
light of day

I will use it when i see your face again

your head in your hands and this is my cue,
if three words could heal you i would only speak two,
your eyelids grow heavy and this is my cue,
If three words could heal you i'd only speak two

How
could you think
after all you put me through
and all you put on my shoulders
that i
would answer your
cries for help?

How
could you think
after all you put me through
and all you put on my shoulders
that i
would answer your
cries for help?

Unleash the rage built up (in my throat)
Show you how you hurt me and
hopefully you see
you have the power
to
destroy
my will to live
