All right!

I left with shaking hands, looking for danger
Cheap tales of modern love, in bed with strangers
And there is no warning, I'm not ignoring
Cut glass on my callused feet
Cause I'd walk through miles of makeshift mud
Motherfucker, I want your blood!

I got the hands of history's stranglers
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
I got the face of a million strangers
You're never gonna see me closing in
Yeah, while you're sleeping!

No need for safe return, is no need for your concern
There is no warning, I'm not ignoring
I follow you across the county lines
Where these beads of sweat feel like a flood
You motherfucker, I want your blood!

I got the hands of history's stranglers
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
I got the face of a million strangers
You're never gonna see me closing in
You're never gonna see me closing in
While you're sleeping!
Breaking through your window!
Stabbing through your ribcage!
