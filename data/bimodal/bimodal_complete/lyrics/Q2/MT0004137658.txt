He rose up from a toilet
Bearing gifts and bleeding from his ass
Inside his disinfected mausoleum
He scrubbed his hands and prepared for surgery
Inside the operating room he screamed
"I believe this patient is already dead"
The nurse's laughter echoed through the halls
As the doctor lit a smoke and shook his head

I have discovered another flaw
In God's sick invention
We have built a time machine
To travel through other dimensions

The mercitron engaged the patient in
A defenseless war against mortality
Angered by the latest turn of events
The doctor felt he should part company
Upon arrival on the planet Mars
While waiting for the mothership to come
Dr. Piranha and his faithful disciples
In orbit searched for a baboon's heart

We are what we are
We are what we are

Christ clones are imprisoned
In slave camps on a planet of trolls
As coal mines and tar pits
Are filled with dead astronauts

Malpractice in the cosmos
The garden of stars is filled with vengeful enemies
Assassins and hitmen eagerly await orders
For research subjects to be purchased by the highest bidder
I will be hunted for an infinity
Detected with a DNA radar, they'll watch my every move
The voices in my head never cease
Mocking me over and over and over and over again

We are what we are
We are what we are

Christ clones are imprisoned
In slave camps on a planet of trolls
As coal mines and tar pits
Are filled with dead astronauts

Christ clones are imprisoned
In slave camps on a planet of trolls
As coal mines and tar pits
Are filled with dead astronauts
