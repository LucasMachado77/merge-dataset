Me nuh care where yuh bad from
Or the ends where yuh trad from
Gun shot mek yuh fall like the bridge ova london
When it kick yuh like vandam
Dis me outa east and meh buck yuh up ah boston
Head ah buss like gaspan
Bullet with gunpowder
No lasco no lass man
Dis kartel and pantan
Push yuh head in yuh mudda pussy like tampon
Yeh big up buju banton
When ah boy ah kick like Jackie Chan over Hong Kong
Our gun go so pam pam
We bad before xman and green lantern
Before snoop live ah compton
So boy nuh tru yuh hear Kartel do him gyul song meh nuh easy feh walk pan
Teflon blackblunt carbon

Yow
We ah badder than them by far
Badder than them by near
In ah peace in ah war
Drive by walk by in car
Gun war fare see the chief of staff here 3 star
Badder than them by far badder than them by near
Yo yo
Yuh brain will get float in
With the big millie 14
My gun carry copper no calcium no protien
So yuh dead when eh soak en
When meh did ah run town with meh gun inna meh short jeans you there ah country ah plant green
So yuh wah war bad man now
By all means when yuh ready bring it on please
And bring yuh friend them small axe fall tall tress
Ah them pussy yuh call g's
When gunshot ah blow them think ah christmas breeze
One catch yuh yuh must freeze
Marrow fly from jamaica cross the west indies
Land ah belize next please
When iron dog bit it wussa than rabbies and it sting like peer bees
Mek big man cry like ladies and babies
Timeless
