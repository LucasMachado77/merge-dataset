Just met a girl down in Boston, I asked her for her name
Said she wouldn't tell me for she was ashamed but I know

Boston baby, Boston baby, why you so scared, why?
Boston baby, Boston baby, I'm gonna take you high

You better stop your crying girl and jump into my car
Said you want overkill, me and you will go far

Boston baby, Boston baby, now you've got it made
Boston baby, Boston baby, your carriages are paid

Boston baby, Boston baby, walking down the street
Boston baby, Boston baby, you'll knock them off their feet
