Open up my heart ,let it splatter on the canvas
Mixing the nostalgia with everyday madness
I try to understand this world bestowed upon us
With areas impoverished to raris with red polish
Think of my place in it, actions based on incentive
A menace fueled by passion and a taste thats expensive
No compassion the for poor or relate that position
Figured I'd just forget em and id let God forgive them
Easier to pass em laughing bout the teeth they was missing
Then to stop and think bout how the man is feeding his children
Excuse me I had to get deep for a minute
Dug some wisdom out my mouth, I feel like a dentist
I break through adversity shoot to the stars
I used to envision the stars as living lavish and large
Take trips to dealerships just to sit in exotic cars
Thought i could get benz by spitting hottest bars
That put me in murky waters I was swimming with jaws
Made 2 many mistakes now im livin with laws
Thank GOD he understands and has forgiven my flaws
Finally i see the stars as living with cause
I see satan trying to pull me back like a riptide
Back to the days when I could barely get by
Dumb dreams all for the wrong things, I'll chase those when pigs fly
Crazy potential but I was trapped up under thin ice
These days I'm at the beach trying to tread water live life
Love life, cause now I got one
Someone bought it for me, you should know his name
God's son, king of kings, prince of peace, in other words bar none
God bless america
Where politicians take naked pictures
Millionaires live in great conditions, eating catered dishes
Visions of greed base decisions to inflate their business
Then dismiss the hunger stricken, who are left defenseless
Are CEOS to blame? or a secret society?
Hate when homeless ask for change you see the irony?
Paranoid of pyramids on a dollar, who got an eye on me
Only Jesus can judge me, so his grace I'm desiring
This world has to many burdens, problems are suffocating
Countries are burning down while leaders are stuck debating
Were caught up in the mix, our fate is flucuating
I'm feeling caged in, like I need oxygen
This world has to many cowards to many politics
Not enough bravery and not enough common sense
Somebodys hurt you help them, that much is obvious
Feel like I can't breathe, like I need Oxygen
