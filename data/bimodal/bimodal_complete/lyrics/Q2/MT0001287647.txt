Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Can't you see there's something wrong? Hit me! Hit me!
My life's shitty and everything's all fucked up
I don't do it for the song. Hit me! Hit me!
I just did it cause it's better than waking up

They said they saw it all along. Hit me! Hit me!
But they figured that I probably made it up
So I said fuck it, fuck it all. Hit me! Hit me!
Oh Mommy, look what I done!

Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

It's like the pills don't work at all. Hit me! Hit me!
I'm not sleeping. My back's up against the wall
And how much farther can I fall? Hit me! Hit me!
There's gotta be something better than alcohol
But now there's no one left to call. Hit me! Hit me!
They won't miss me. Nobody will cry or ball
So I said fuck it, fuck it all. Hit me! Hit me!
Oh Mommy, look what I done!

Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water

Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home

Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
Slit my wrists in ice water, you'll find me when you get home
