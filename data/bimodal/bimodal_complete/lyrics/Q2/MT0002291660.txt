Born to fight, born to win
We were all born to be skins
Born with Martens on our feet
Facing truth there's no retreat

People fear us, think we're strange
Boots and braces, we won't change
We will never be second best
You know us, we're The Oppressed!

We are skinheads, we are proud
Playing music for the crowd
Music for the working class
Stick your disco up your arse

People fear us, think we're strange
Boots and braces, we won't change
We will never be second best
You know us, we're The Oppressed!
People fear us, think we're strange
Boots and braces, we won't change
We will never be second best
You know us, we're The Oppressed!

Born to fight, born to win
We were all born to be skins
Born with Martens on our feet
Facing truth there's no retreat

People fear us, think we're strange
Boots and braces, we won't change
We will never be second best
You know us, we're The Oppressed!
Oh yeah!
