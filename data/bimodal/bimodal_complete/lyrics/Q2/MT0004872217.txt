Michael Stipe - sissy whining tart
Fucking Phil Collins - the pent-up fart
Stevie Wonder seems way too glad
Gary Moore is not bluesy but sad
Armstrong, Leblanc and the doped detour
Sorry Stephen King - there ain't no cure
Michael Jackson's too kind to the kids
DJ Ötzi fucking swindler bitch

No excuse is the game tonight
No fucking reasons - just annoy and ignite
Delivering a genuine reason to cry
Make my day - go ahead and die

Britney's Beers - show us your clit
Claudia Schiffer - because you're not worth it
Ewan McGregor don't deserve the force
Céline Dion's got the face of a horse
No more surgery for little Richard
Osama - where've you Bin? - you fucking coward
Dieter Bolen is a popstar fool
Bill Gates needs a new hairdo
No excuse is the game tonight
No fucking reasons - just annoy and ignite
Delivering a genuine reason to cry
Make my day - go ahead and die

Bob Geldorf - self-righteous Santa
Axle Rose and his ugly bandanna
Germany's national football team
Play like shit - but they always win
Hairball Nickelback - epic cry-baby
Steve Martin - where's the fun gone lately
Jimmy Page could have been eternally all right
If not for Puff Daddy - the fucking parasite

No excuse is the game tonight
No fucking reasons - just annoy and ignite
Delivering a genuine reason to cry
Make my day - go ahead and die
