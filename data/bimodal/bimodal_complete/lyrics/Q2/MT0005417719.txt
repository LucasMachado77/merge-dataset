Right now shiggity-show 'em how my crew get down
Right now das efx puttin' it down
Right now e'rybody raise it up
Right now we about to blaze it up

Right now shiggity-show 'em how my crew get down
Right now das efx puttin' it down
Right now e'rybody raise it up
Right now we about to blaze it up

Diggity-drop the new talk, from jersey and new york
We holdin' down the fort in the sport, what y'all thought?
Diggy-das what? lick off shots and hip-hop
It don't stop, I riggity-rock blocks when my shit drop

Boogie bang banger, cock back the rap hammer
Bust grammar, I stay bent like a coathanger
(niggity-no manners) up in here with my skullie on
Fully on, riggity-rockin fatigues like desert storm

Yo, figgity-face it, we lace it, far from basic
Taste it, shine like diamonds in ya bracelet
(Higgity-hey kid) me and my squad about to blow
Let it go, briggity-bringin' the hook and let 'em know

Right now shiggity-show 'em how my crew get down
Right now das efx puttin' it down
Right now e'rybody raise it up
Right now we about to blaze it up

Yo, yo
I bought a glock off a puerto rock (where?)
Off a block and fo' green back when I was 14
Now my thug's punk crilli, the thug willies
We're mack milli, cowardly cats get smacked silly
Want to beef? get back, on and the street get splashed
From your cheek, past your ass til your feet
Crab nigga duck shiggity-shots from the aimed glocks
Fall on your head like raindrops til your brain pops

Yo yo
I got a chick that'll lie for me
Die for me, shoot ya in your eye for me
Get high with me, the unfadeable, ungradeable
You wiggity-waste your time 'cause I'm unrateable
See, figgity-find me in the benz on the backstreet
Listenin' to blackstreet, fuckin' in the back seat
What? '98 thug mania, bring the pain to ya
And ain't no savin ya when I start blazin ya

Right now shiggity-show 'em how my crew get down
Right now das efx puttin' it down
Right now e'rybody raise it up
Right now we about to blaze it up

Right now shiggity-show 'em how my crew get down
Right now das efx puttin' it down
