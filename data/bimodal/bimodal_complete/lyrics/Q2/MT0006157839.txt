Don't count me in, 'cos this time it's for real
A wake-up call I never knew
My grandfather was cannon-fodder
To think he died for the likes of you

Don't let me down again
Down again
Down again
Down again

In my cold blood, I'm bent right out of shape
But this is something, something else
You're high on fight, who's there to talk you down?
How do you sleep, little man?

You let us down again
Down again
Down again
Down again
Here we go
Don't count me in
Not in my name
Not in our name
Not in any name
Not in any way

Don't count me in
Don't count me in
Don't count me in
Don't count me in

You let me down again
Down again
Down again
Down again

Here we go
Don't count me in
Not in my name
Not in our name
Not in any name
Not in any way

Not in my name
Not in our name
Not in any name
Not in any way
