I exclude light and wash my hands of you
By larger being devoured, leaving only me to improve
Weep, don't fucking weep
Your weak eyes cry tears of the meek

You're expectant to the Bible, fiending all the foes in middle
Don't you see in the mirror that you're the selfish shit?
Shot glass seems to hug your soul, there's no point to grow
You don't have time to explore, you're already broke

Weep

Weep, don't fucking weep
Your weak eyes cry tears of the meek
Weep, catch up with the sheep
'Cause it's a sacrilegious ceremony, new flavor of the week
Nothing's sacred in the faces of
The soulless that you're made into
The soulless that you're made into
The soulless that you're made into
You're raptured by a guilty stifle down
You're raptured by a guilty stifle down

I wash my hands of you

And what I'll do is mess you up and lie to you
Look at you, you know it's true
It's a field trip to Hollywood Babylon
But I'm not coming, no
