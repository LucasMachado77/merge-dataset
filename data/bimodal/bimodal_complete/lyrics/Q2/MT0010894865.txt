Into the Valley of Death
You'll take your last breath
But you don't realise
That the heat can fry your eyes

Down in the Valley of Death....

Not a soul can live
Because the heat's too much to bear
If you battle in the sun
You've got no chance, it's already won

There's nothing there to be found
'cept skeletons on the ground
You can stand there and weep
Over things that used ot be sheep
Water there is just like gold
People kill for it, I've been told
Melting sorrow, the suffering cry
Hell on earth, what a place to die
