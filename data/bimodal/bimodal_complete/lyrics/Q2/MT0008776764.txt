You call me this
You say I'm that
You wanna
Label me some kind of outcast
Like a dreaded disease to the environment
My kind tips the scale of discontent

So more power to me cause I'm with it
You think that you're the one
To come and get it
There's no front for me to hide behind
You want me gone
Pick a number and wait in line

Come as your are
Raise the dead
Fuel the fires
That explode in my head

Labels are just a name
I'll stay true to the game
Labels are just a name
I'll stay true to the game

(You don't know me
You can't see me)
You don't know me
You can't see me

I've learned to put your shit behind me
(Open your eyes take a look and see)
Open your eyes and take a look and see

Now the clock ticks down to the moment when
You open your mouth
Why don't you learn to speak?
'Cause nobody must've told you that your talk was cheap
Did I in any way mislead to you believe in
That there was a chance
I'd leave your daughter grieving?

All the stupids thoughts you had of me in your head
Sometimes it makes me think that you'd be better of dead
So just put an end to your tragic unhappy life
A lesson learned tables turned
Time to pay the piper

Come as your are
Raise the dead
Fuel the fires
That explode in my head

You got me labeled all wrong
I survive because I'm strong
