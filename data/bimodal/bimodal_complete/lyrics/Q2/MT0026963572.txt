Always darkest before the dawn
But we will win and take it all
What we want is what we say
And nothing will stand in our way
We won't give up to make things right
If you're in our way you'll have to fight
We won't take any more abuse
We'll take revenge for what you do

We want our lives
We want our brains
You want control
But we won't pay
We want a fight
To have a chance
To change the future
Erase the past

You ask me why do I hate
How much more can I fucking take
Very soon we'll take over
Then you better run for cover
You laugh at us from behind our backs
Just fucking wait till we attack
You type is someone we despise
Watch the slaughter from where you hide
