There she slumps at the end of the couch
One last drink, she's going to pass out
Instead he smokes her up with a joint
To make sure she sees that pass out point
Now her bodies like a rock and she's fast asleep
With his macho man hands he begins to creep
But that girl, you know she can't resist
The womanizer got her too damn pissed

Now she's just another victim of a womanizer
He's gonna take her home, get her drunk, then fuck her
Now she's just another victim of a womanizer
He don't care, he got laid and proved to the world that he isn't gay

The next morning he kicks her out of his bed
Don't want to see your fucking face again
A fine example of his quick relations
The kind that end on ejaculation
So she had used feelings, she can't get rid
Throws herself off a fucking bridge
But the womanizer has no regrets
At least he got his big dick wet
Now she's just another victim of a womanizer
He's gonna take her home, get her drunk, then fuck her
Now she's just another victim of a womanizer
He don't care, he got laid and proved to the world that he isn't gay

Well I hate your kind you low-life worm
Girls are more than just a storage space for your sticky sperm
They can be companions, They can be friends
And not just someone that you take to bed

Now she's just another victim of a womanizer
He's gonna take her home, get her drunk, then fuck her
Now she's just another victim of a womanizer
He don't care, he got laid
Proved to the world that he isn't gay
Proved to the world that he isn't gay
Proved to the world that he isn't gay
Proved to the world that he isn't... (gay)
