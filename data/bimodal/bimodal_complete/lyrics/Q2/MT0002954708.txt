Come with the bloody moon and the chaos
Gog and Magog triple six reigns over spirits lost
Satanic nations and thrones reign and slay
But solid is super-souls love and righteous pathways

Asking me why I ain't down with the bloodshed
Wicked fool we approve of lies as eternal truth
Worship the mark of the beast demonic feast
Seven the seals sacred faith no need to pack steal

No "Geed-up" rap anywhere up and on me
Strictly KRS, Public Enemy, Bob Marley
Mad ups to MLK and the infinite Ghandi
Doom to the demons that dominate all around me

Deep in the soul fool
You know you ain't right running around with your eyes shut tight
I know what it's like to not want to see the sunrise
So shattered the pictures on fire, the winter never lies

But that chemical won't always keep the empty space full
Bludgeon corrode desecrate the body temple
Half the fools we know yes they sick style sprung
Deeper and further from ourselves I have always watched us run

From the family perspective yes I've watched the dope wreck shit
Deep "Veteranos, Tequatos" fool this childhood knows
Deep in the soul
Fool you know you ain't right going around with them eyes shut tight

Further away from ourselves, further away from the truth
You can throw the set in the sky
But the eternal majestic Mount Zion you can't deny
A gat, a clip, a hollow-tip with your name on it

Loving to trip but one day you'll get caught up and slip
So cheap a death but my brother so precious is life
Speaking the language of fratricidal sights
You do like "Cain" did "Abel" you love to watch your brother's blood
Flow fool tell me no, spirit so cold! Denial
