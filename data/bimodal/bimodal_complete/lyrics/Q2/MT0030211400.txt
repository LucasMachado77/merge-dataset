You wanna see me
You've gotta come around
And I know you're talking
About me all around this town
And I know you're thinking
That I'm coming on too strong
You've gotta realize
That I've got it goin' on

But you had to turn away
When I walked into the room
Had to shield your eyes

I've got the best in me
And I know you're thinking
I move electrically
And I'm truly feeling
That I'm coming on too strong
I had to walk to run
To have it goin' on
