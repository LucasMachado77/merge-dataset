Difference of living alone
A way of life that soon will show
Seen it from the start
They will make the stone melt and we will rot
Misleading to wipe the race away
Not knowing the next to fall
A messenger with the written word

Feel it, fell as it swallows you whole
The divine flames caress
The flames will lead the way
Ending you without a breath

Wrapped with elegance
The printed manifest will make the start
Every word written, everything I say
Trying to get back to what seems normal
Ending fast and in decay, no light I hardly see
Working to prove that I'm right
Sending the celestial gift to the first one to go
This time a deadly way out
Would there be any to follow:?
Yes there will
Feel it, fell as it swallows you whole
The divine flames caress
The flames will lead the way
Ending you without a breath
Now listen what I have to say
Advance, my first weapon of choice
A step ahead, I make no mistakes:

Take note of everything happened
My manifest is taking form
Simplicity, this makes them fall
See what you turned this into

Going higher in the hierachy
This time will hurt
Leaving a trace behind for the puzzle
Confusing factor this will be

I hide in the shadows of lies
Drawn characters has no resemblance
I redefine my craftmanship
Nothing like others
Corpes will be numbered
Sending the final note to the one survived
Telling that this was just a lie
Feel it, fell as it swallows you whole
The divine flames caress
The flames will lead the way
Ending you without a breath
Now listen what I have to say
Advance, my first weapon of choice
A step ahead, I make no mistakes:
