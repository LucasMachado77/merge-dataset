They're so persuasive, with their fucking lies
Not an ounce of respect
They'll do anything to sell deception

Burn the lies
Their words of ignorance
Shove them back
Back down their throats
All that I have for you is hate

They will quickly abandon, what little moral they have
Tell you that you are worth nothing, with no regard for anyone

Burn the lies
Their words of ignorance
Shove them back
Back down their throats
All that I have for you is hate

I'm filled with hate
Filled with hate
I'm filled with hate
