Gonna be a fight tonight
We're moving in, we're taking over
We're gonna have some fun tonight
If you can't take the heat, stay outta the street
Yesterdays heroes are forgotten today
And todays won't be remembered tomorrow
All the ideas must be swept away
No time for pity or sorrow

We're gonna kick some heads tonight
If you don't have friends you better take cover
The crews all here tonight
We've moved in, we've taken over
It don't matter how long you've been around
You're either real or just a wanna be
It's time for all you kids to realize
You either join or be left behind

We're gonna kick some heads tonight
If you don't have friends you better take cover
The crews all here tonight
We've moved in, we've taken over
It don't matter how long you've been around
You're either real or just a wanna be
It's time for all you kids to realize
You either join or be left behind
