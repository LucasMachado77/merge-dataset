This song is definitely not the operation provocation
I'm writing this of respect of all the punkbands in the nation
I have such faith in people like you that really dare to disagree
And for all the times you've helped us spread the words making mp3's

I'm so glad that you're still the same, with the same name. I love the person you became
I wanna be just like you, just like you
And I'm so glad that you're not hostile, that you're wearing a smile & care less about style
I wanna be just like you, just like you

Among all the places, a million faces but I'll never meet someone like you
Bleeding on the stage when we disengage the happiness that we possess
And I am so glad that you'll never turn into a stranger
I'm keeping you in my mind everyday, when I'm far away and when I feel deranged

I'm so glad that you're still the same, with the same name. I love the person you became
I wanna be just like you, just like you
And I'm so glad that you're not hostile, that you're wearing a smile & care less about style
I wanna be just like you, just like you
To have you on my side fills me with pride, stronger then a castle inside
I cannot throw anger at you, I'm attached to you, you've been with us since our debut
I'm glad that you're still the same, with the same name
I love the person you became and I wanna be just like you

Let me dedicate this song to those who never act in frustration
Let me give this song to those who have respect for all the punkbands in the nation
Let me pass this song to all the people that dare to disagree
Let me dedicate this song to those who downloaded this song as a mp3

I'm so glad that you're still the same, with the same name. I love the person you became
I wanna be just like you, just like you
And I'm so glad that you're not hostile, that you're wearing a smile & care less about style
I wanna be just like you, just like you
