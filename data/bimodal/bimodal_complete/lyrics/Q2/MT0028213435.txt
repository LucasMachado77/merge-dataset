Gamble my life away, a real bum boozer
Made love on dope, just a pig skin loser
Looked around at this joint
For a living there was no point

Cranked up really high
Cranked up really high

All ideas, I'm shaking my fists
Had a million thoughts yeah to slit my wrists
Hallucination in my dream
I gotta leave, gotta leave this scene

Cranked up really high
Cranked up really high

Getting high on glue and cocaine
Jabbing things into my vein
Lucifer lord holding my hand
Pushing pills to a rock and roll band

Cranked up really high
Cranked up really high
