Switch the light on, we can think it's dawn
Oh, push along, push along, play a long song
I'm laughing at Marine, Marine laughs back, don't love
Don't like those boys, toy soldier boys, I'm lying in bed

You can play me fear, you can play me fear
Only rhythm I hear, you cut me up with joys of life
I'm going somewhere, I'm going someplace
If caution is life then caution is sin
Contort contort contort, I'll win

These walls that close, close in on me
Seductress shout, seductress scream
Switch the light on, we can think it's dawn
Oh, push along, pray along, play a long song

Switch the light on, we can think it's dawn
Oh, push along, ray along, play a long song
I'm laughing at Marine, Marine laughs back, don't laugh
Don't like those boys, toy soldier boys, I'm lying in bed

You can play me fear, you can play me fear
Only rhythm I hear, you cut me up with joys of life
I'm going somewhere, I'm going someplace
If caution is life then caution is sin
Contort contort contort, I'll win

These walls that close, close in on me
Seductress shout, seductress scream
Switch the light on, we can think it's dawn
Oh, push along, pray along, play a long song

Switch the light on, we can think it's dawn
Oh, push along, pray along, play a long song
I'm laughing at Marine, Marine laughs back, don't laugh
Don't like those boys, toy soldier boys, I'm lying in bed

You can play me fear, you can play me fear
Only rhythm I hear, you cut me up with joys of life
I'm going somewhere, I'm going someplace
If caution is life then caution is sin
Contort contort contort, I'll win

These walls that close, close in on me
Seductress shout, seductress scream
Switch the light on, we can think it's dawn
Oh, push along, pray along, play a long song
