Step down (Reach in)
Line these walls with something new
Dress these wounds with what we've found
Stitch your mouth and save this curse for me

Wake up sleepyhead it's time
I cut these hands tonight

Let this be the last time I fear your eyes
I came back

Stitch your mouth and save this curse for me

Line these walls with something new
Dress these wounds with what we've found
Stitch your mouth and save this curse for me
Wake up sleepyhead it's time
I cut these hands tonight

This was forever
This time

Stitch your mouth and let this sin sit quietly on your tongue
