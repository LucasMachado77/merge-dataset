The architect of murder gets top billing
Yet another victim another slaying
Sirens, flashing lights, police line: DO NOT CROSS
Blood on the sidewalk, paramedics on the scene
Up pulls the coroner's truck, I heard someone say
"This poor sucker's run out of luck"

Casualty Vampires, thirsting for blood
Casualty vampires, there's never enough

Casualty Vampires sharpen thier teeth
Surrond the t.v
Waiting for the roster of casualties
Jet crash, Newscasters tell us of disaster
How many were lost?
Casualty Vampires, See nothing but red
Casualty Vampires, It's in all of our heads

Stop to watch, stand and stare
At yet another carcass lying there
Earthquake bomb blast, domestic quarrel
What does it matter so long as there's blood

Casualty Vampires, Drive along the freeways
Casualty Vampires, craning there necks
Casualty Vampires, pass right by
Casualty Vampires, look at all the wrecks
