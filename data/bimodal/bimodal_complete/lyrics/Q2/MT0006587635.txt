Big Bang
Day one is born
I'm coming through
God at the table
Science by the table
What will it be?

A war...
...ending in decay

Never knowing how it became
My life ending in turmoil
Leaving a trace from my finger
Passed on for generations
Twisted but still whole
It is pumping in my veins
A reflection
A reflection - within my pain

Not knowing how it was like this
Withholding the conerstones of life
It has been left inside me
You tell me that I alone am the one
The one who matches the past
A past that should be in my skin
The more I kow...
The more I see...

Time is ending, no more control
The root of the past is now done
You found the traces of the past
A tree showing how it was done
Murder...
Betrayer...
I'm the one who carries the past
He was the root of the past
An ancestor who has made the ground
That I now stand on

A life that should reflect in me
It was said in the books that I'm the one
Traces all through my body
I see the ancestor in me
It has been part of many troops
Troops roaming the globe
Preparing to see my destiny
Reaped as we are sown
I am - the spawn of history
I am - the traces of the past
I have - been constructed
I have - your blood in my veins

Traces of the past
