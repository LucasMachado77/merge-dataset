All through time I've been a menace
Smashing it down when it comes to you
Breaking your heart by the early morning
Leaving you bare as I plow on through

All through time I've been respected
Force to be reckoned with, feared and loved
Demolition is my business
Your life crumbles down from the blow from above

Can you hear the tribe drumming?
Better hold all my calls
Cuz it heralds my coming
As I'm knocking down walls
