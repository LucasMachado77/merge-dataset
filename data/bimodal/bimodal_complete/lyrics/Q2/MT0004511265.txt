You knew what I was gonna say
When I didn't
I did anyway
It seems
I'll survive with self respect intact
And you?

Every freedom needs a trust
This trust will kill again for you
And someone else won't believe their eyes
While a thousand will believe that it's true
This trust will kill again for you

Through tales of objectivity you shake my hands
All that objectivity could break them both

Whatever I say
Context aside
You got what you need
Make sure I say what they want to read

Every freedom needs a trust
This trust will kill again for you
And someone else won't believe their eyes
While a thousand will believe that it's true
This trust will kill again for you
It won't happen again
I'll survive with self respect intact
They're telling me that I should have known better
Well, now I know
Now I know
And now I know
Yeah!

All that objectivity
Nothing
All that objectivity
Nothing
