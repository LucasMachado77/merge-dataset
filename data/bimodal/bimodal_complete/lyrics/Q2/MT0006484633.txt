Breathing fire
Hatred has made you know
Promise of more hatred than before
The Legacy will roam
For centuries to come
Let the pressure ease
And the blood will boil

Born in flames
My silent empire no longer will be
Making the ground trumble-
I will soon reign
The circle is complete
Your work is done here
You cannot fly with those burned wings

The time has come to die
You will not go down by yourself
Bringing many to come
Taking you down to my hell...

Stalking to the end of time
Welcome to my hell
My friend of fire, my demon
Can you hear, the answer has arrived
See my colony of hate grow
A colony that grows from the inside...
From inside...
FROM INSIDE
The flames will reach high -
You'll become my slave
Brought to my altar of sacrifice
They will know when they see my eye
Yellow as the sun - smooth as the cat
Near the earths core
All the seven gates are open

They stand with mouth open and gaze
See my arrival
On flowing consuming flame
Cane in the ground -
This is my metropolis...
...the dark age has arrived

Born in flames
My silent empire no longer will be
Making the ground trumble-
I will soon reign
The circle is complete
Your work is done here
You cannot fly with those burned wings
The time has come to die
You will not go down by yourself
Bringing many to come
Taking you down to my hell...

Sculpture of the dead
Skulls in fine
Chandeliers of bone
Sulphur in veins
