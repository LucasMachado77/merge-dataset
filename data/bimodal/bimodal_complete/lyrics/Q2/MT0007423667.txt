I am peripheral movement
I am a figure without form
I am a person seen from a distance
Rebirth to a new life transcribed in wires

From a new life
Growing to hate decisive moments
The only thing within a breath of real

So now I fall to my knees and beg in earnest
To what powers may govern the sky
Just let me sleep one night, one night without these dreams
These dreams that always haunt me
Nothing
No
Life gets longer the day I realize
I can't breathe deeply enough to fill me
With every disappointment

Nothing happens
And the man I might have been
Nothing ever happens
And all the great things that I will never do

Growing to hate decisive lows
All I can do is watch it pass
I resonate at the pitch of discontent
I am peripheral movement

Life gets longer today I realize
I can't breathe deeply enough to fill me
With every disappointment
And break my heart the way it deserves

Nothing happens
And the man I might have been
Nothing ever happens
And all the great things that I will never do
Nothing happens
And the man I might have been
Nothing ever happens
And all the great things that I will never do
