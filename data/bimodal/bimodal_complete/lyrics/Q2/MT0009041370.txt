When the screen turns, it's too late
No one's to burn but yourself
I want to buy everything you got
No hope now for a TV junk

24 hour bullshit
24 hour bullshit

I want out, don't want your help
Spend my time trying to distance myself
Fall in line, now follow suit
It's my God and my religion

24 hour bullshit
24 hour bullshit

I want to buy everything you got
I could care less

24 hour bullshit

Beer, gun, car and TV
That's all I need

I want to buy everything you got
I could care less

24 hour bullshit

Beer, gun, car and TV
That's all I need
