This episode played over, over and again
Your routine gets old
And I doubt you're one to change

I can feel your eyes burning through me
Your eyes of courage, Your eyes of strength
Burning right through me, 
Burning right through me
Burning.

But when it's all said and through, 
You're still a sight for sore eyes
With one deep breath, 
I scream to you, 
"I promise you, I will never fucking change!"

Not me. Not now. Not me. Not now.

You said "It's been forever since I've last seen you"
And sometimes I wish you knew
How important you are to me.
And what I wouldn't give to be able
To call you my friend... 

You whisper in my ear, 
You whisper "I hate you"
You whisper "I hate you"
You whisper "I hate you"
You whisper "I hate you"
