Time is drifting away
To form another day
With or without me
My faith to be
Tomorrow I will not see

'Be it the deepest of dreams
Or the darkest of deaths
Nor can either of these
Truly guarantee my release'

Staring at these four walls
Remembering what I have achieved
Enter the tomb of the deceived
All that where is lost
Whores of mankind
Take my fuckin' life
Alone I'll be
One with the dreams in red

Flatlined and cold I lay
Victim of their play
In the shadows of the obscure
My soul forever never more
