All the guys, they look oh so stupid
And I wanna know why
All the girls, they get so impressed
That it makes me wanna die

All that long hair makes me whine
It's '95 not '69
I don't think it's very nice
Guys looking like Jesus Christ

A-whoa-oh
A-whoa-oh

Big, fat, ugly jocks with hairdos
Look like fucking clowns
And everyone knows
They're just the biggest jerks around
I'm asking you on bending knees
Change that hairdo, won't you please?
Lose that ponytail, you'll see
That you'd be so cool like me
A-whoa-oh

Won't you, won't you cut it, dude?
Won't you, won't you cut it, dude?
Won't you, won't you cut it, dude?
Then you'd be so cool like me

All the guys, they look oh so stupid

Won't you, won't you cut it, dude?
Won't you, won't you cut it, dude?

A-whoa-oh
Won't you, won't you cut it, dude?...
