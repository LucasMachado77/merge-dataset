I wish I had
Seen you in front of your T.V set
I wish I'd seen you
When you blew up
What seemed to be the whole world to you
I wish I woke up
When you were sad
I wish I had
Seen you in front of your T.V set

All alone in your room
You blew up your television
The whole world to you
And less of you is left

On your own in your room
You blew up your television
The whole world to you
And less of you is left

I wish I had
Seen you in front of your T.V set
I wish I'd seen you
When you blew up
What seemed to be the whole world to you
All alone in your room
You blew up your television
The whole world to you
And less of you is left

On your own in your room
You blew up your television
The whole world to you
And less of you is left

I wish I could take you outside and
I wish I saw the rest of you here

I wish I could take you outside and
I wish I saw the rest of you here

On your own in your room
You blew up your television
The whole world to you
And less of you is left

I wish I could take you outside and
I wish I saw the rest of you here ....
