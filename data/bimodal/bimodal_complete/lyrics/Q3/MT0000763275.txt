I was brought up in an ideal home
Bay windows let the sunshine in
Natural light chased the shadows
I was brought up in an ideal home

In an ideal home
Nothing you do can go wrong
In an ideal home
Everything's safe and you can
Sit by the fire
Read a good book or watch TV

Miserable songs from the house next door
Perhaps they're planning to end it all
They should come around to our house
Like the sunshine, in our ideal home
In an ideal home (in an ideal home)
Nothing you do can go wrong
In an ideal home (in an ideal home)
There's never an awkward silence
Turn out the lights
Sit in the dark and watch the stars
Everything's safe in an ideal home

In an ideal home
In an ideal home
In an ideal home
