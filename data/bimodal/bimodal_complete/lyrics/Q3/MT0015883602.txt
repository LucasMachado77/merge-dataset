It's a fact, I know that love is strange
Play so many crazy games
Love can come and love may go
Both sides have to bear the hurt, I know

Let's just say, enough's enough
And call it a love, honey, I fell for your bluff

I'm sitting here and drowning in my sorrow
I hope things aren't like this tomorrow

Honey, we both know how hard we tried
Every story has two sides
And love is young but love gets old
Love is hot and sometimes love gets cold
Just like the fool that keeps hanging on
Wondering where our love went wrong
I'm sitting here and drowning in my sorrow
I hope things aren't like this tomorrow

My friends say all I need is time
But I can't seem to get you off my mind
Forgetting is something that is hard to do
It's keeping me from getting over you

And I don't wanna hear how your times are hard
I got to pull the weeds from my own backyard
I'm sitting here and drowning in my sorrow
I hope things aren't like this tomorrow
I'm sitting here and drowning in my sorrow
I hope things aren't like this tomorrow

It's a fact, I know that love is strange
Play so many crazy games
And love can come and love may go
And both sides have to bear the hurt, I know
