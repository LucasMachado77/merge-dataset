This dark room, another cigarette
The carpet's strewn, I'm getting sick of it
The end is near, I'm in the thick of it
And I'll be there soon, if you can handle it

Just save me, from all that I am
You save me, for the fuck of it
Save me, just hold out your hand
You save me, from all of it

I try to speak myself, you can do it too
I need no ones help, I'm needing only you
So just pray for me, and deliver it
You never take from me, what I'm giving

Just save me, from all that I am
You save me, for the fuck of it
Save me, just hold out your hand
You save me, from all of it

And all that I've become is you
The only good in me is you
And after all of this, the day will come to find out will you
Take me, or forsake me
So pray for me, am I forgiven
For what you take from me

Just save me, from all that I am
You save me, for the fuck of it
Save me, just hold out your hand
You save me, from all of it
Come save me

Pray for me, am I forgiven
