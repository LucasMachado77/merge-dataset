I am a kind of Lady of Shalott
Behind a drawbridge, portcullis and a moat
I glide like a ghost in my boat
The white swan nobody can own

Why do they all try to kiss me?
Why do you try to release me?

If I lowered my defences
You would know how I feel inside
If I gave you the key to my chastity belt
You could totally destroy my pride

I would turn to sugar, crumble
I would gaze and sigh and mumble
Like an idiot with a head full of flowers
You could undermine my pride
Do whatever you liked
We'd live the Duc De Berry's
'Very Rich Hours'
Then you would penetrate me

( ..... to the first light)
(From the white night to the first light) 
(From the white night to the first light) 
(From the white night to the first light) 
(From the white night to the first light) 
(From the white night to the first light) 

From white night to first light
You can see why I have to hide
I'd only get hurt, you'd treat me like dirt
The moment I let you inside
I'll be your best, the best you never had
Your unicorn, your butterfly
Your falcon, your lad
I am a kind of Lady of Shallot
My drawbridge, portcullis and moat
The chastity belt round my throat
I am a kind of Lady of Shalott
