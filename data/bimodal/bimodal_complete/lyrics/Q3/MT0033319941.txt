Hey Dear
You know I hate to go
Just lay here
Listening to the radio
Upstairs
Hiding from the world below
The day fading on the dial

Downstairs
Wait for the mailman
On lawn chairs
Spread across the tableland
Somewhere
Flowerbeds to lay your hand in mine
If you stay then I will
Time fading on the dial
I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do
The song is fading still it's true
When I'm here beside you

You said
You want a wing to fly
A loose thread
Hanging from the gingham sky
We knew that
We would have to say goodbye
C'mon, if you would then I'd stay
The sun pulling in the driveway

I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do
The song is fading still it's true
When I'm here beside you

I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do
The song is fading still it's true
When I'm here beside you

The song is fading...
