Oh Red, what should I do?
Oh Red, what should I do?
I'm sick an tired of askin' ya to sing them blues
Now Red, let's dance a while

Oh Red, let's dance a while
I'm sick an tired, tellin' ya to hold my hand
Oh Red, let's break 'em down
Oh Red, let's break 'em down

I'm sick an tired, tellin' ya to hold my hand
Now Red, you sweet to me
Oh Red, you sweet to me
But I'm sick an tired, tellin' ya to hold my hand

Oh Red, we gonna swing a while
Oh Red, we gonna swing a while
I'm sick an tired, tellin' ya to hold my hand
