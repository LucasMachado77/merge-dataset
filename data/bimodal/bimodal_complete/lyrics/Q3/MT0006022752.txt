I have had my fun
And if I never get well no more
I have had my fun
And if I never get well no more
Well my health it's failing on me
Yes, I'm going down slow

Please write my mother
Tell her the shape I'm in
Please write my mother
And, oh, tell her the shape I'm in
"Well, all right, Muddy Waters, sing it for me"

And, oh, you know I want her to pray for me
The forgiveness of my sins
"Bo Diddley, can you sing that?"
"Bo Diddley can't sing that, don't ask him to sing that"

Oh, I've had my fun
If I don't get well no more
Oh, I've had my fun
If I don't get well no more

("Both you and Muddy Waters ain't singing nothing")
Like I never loved a woman before
("I want you to hear me howling this")

"Watch Wolf!"

On the next train south
Oh, look for my close home
On the next train south
Oh, look for my close home
If you don't see my body

All you can do is just weep and moan

Mother, please don't you worry

"Yeah, Muddy can't howl like me, though"
"I'm the king"
Hey, Mama I don't want you to be worrying about me
"I'm the Wolf. I'm the king, amongst all the men that sing the blues"
Mother, this is all in my prayer
"And they're just jealous"
"Soul! Soul! Yeah, he got his soul"
Hey, just say your son is gone
Out of this world somewhere
Awooo
Awooo
Awooo
"Do that again!"
