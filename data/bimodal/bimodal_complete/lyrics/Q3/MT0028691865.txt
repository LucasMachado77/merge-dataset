Goin' back home, just as soon as God break day
Goin' back home, just as soon as the good Lord break a day
Whoa, you know this ain't no place for me
And I don't think po' Lightnin wanna stay
Married woman, she the sweetest thing, man, in this world
Married woman, she the sweetest thing, man, in this world
You know why I know it? I got one
Every night she lays in po' Lightnin's arms
Sometimes, she calls me her little boy
Listen at me, I calls her my little girl
Sometimes, she call me her little boy
Listens at me, sometimes I call her my little girl
Yes, when that woman go to kiss me
Po' Lightnin think he's out of this world
