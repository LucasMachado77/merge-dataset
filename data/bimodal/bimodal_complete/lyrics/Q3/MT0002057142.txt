Don't you go without me
Don't go and leave me here

When I lie on my side
Feel my heart being crushed
Falling through the spaces
Falling through an unlit scene

Sleep dust on your eyelids
Mahjong tiles flicker serene
Play the four winds in dim lit bars
Aqualung feels heavy

Don't you go without me
Don't you go and leave me here
