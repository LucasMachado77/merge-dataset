I'm planning my release
Tonight I'll speak the words I never
Thought I'd ever have to say to you
Hope it stings you so deeply
For a moment you might see me
And I'll leave you there alone
One more thing that you should know
I'm not ever coming home

Think we should finally let this go
We both know it's the end of the road
All I ever needed
Someone to believe in
Anything that I could do
Maybe there's something beautiful

Hidden deep in my bones
I'll get as far as I can go
Where I run, you never will know
When you're left there lying alone
Know I'm never coming home

I think we've had enough time to know
So know that when I go
It's the end of the road
Know where I go, it's the end of the road
It's the end of the road
I'm never coming home
See, i' am never coming home
See, i'am never coming home
See they!!
