Someone's gotta cry when love is over and as you leave it's very plain to see
You're not about to cry for you're in love again
But someone's gotta cry and that leaves me
There's very little left to say the goodbyes have been said
But anytime a true love dies a few tears must be shed
Someone's gotta cry that makes it final and in her arms is where you wanna be
You smile at her she smiles at you you're happy
But someone's gotta cry and that leads me

There's very little left to say...
