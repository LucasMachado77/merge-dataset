When you hear this song
Wherever you are think of me
And don't forget to stand up and make a toast to me
Hold your head up high
And love the guy with the big fine car
And don't forget I still love you
Wherever you are

You just wouldn't love me no matter how I tried
And the day you left my world I just up and died
But every night you'll still find me wishing on a star
All because I still love you wherever you are

I've got to explain to the friends we once knew
They've got to get used to seeing me without you
If you all alone I hate to say I told you so
And I hope this song reminds you I still love you so

If he should close you out
Remember my arms are always open
'Cause I still love you wherever you are
