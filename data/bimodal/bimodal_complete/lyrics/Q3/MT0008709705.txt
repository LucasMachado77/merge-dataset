Oh lordy Lord, oh lordy Lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part
But someday, baby
You ain't gonna worry my life any more

You're on my mind every place I go
But how I love her, nobody knows
Oh, but someday, baby
You ain't gonna worry my life any more

You're on my mind every place I go
But how I love her, nobody knows
Oh, but someday, baby
You ain't gonna worry my life any more

So that's my story, all I've got to say to you:
Bye-bye, baby, I ain't got no more to say
Oh, but someday, baby
Lord, I ain't gonna worry my life any more
