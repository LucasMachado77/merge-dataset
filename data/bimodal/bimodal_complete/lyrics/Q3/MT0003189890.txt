Bad luck is in my family
Though it all have fell on me
Bad luck is in my family
Though it all have fell on me
Yes I'm the bad, luckiest fella baby
That you most have ever seen

My woman, she out quit me baby
And all my womens have put me down
My woman, she out quit me baby
And all my womens have put me down
Yes I've got no money in my pocket baby
And my friends don't come around

Whoa, what would I do baby?
If my wife would come back to me
Whoa, what would I do?
If my wife would come back to me
Well we should try once more baby
I'll be the best guy that you ever seen
