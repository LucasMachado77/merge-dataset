She asked me would I do her one last favor
Would I wait around and take her to the plane
I said I would and waited by the window
And outside I saw the misty morning rain

Misty morning rain please keep on falling
Make her think my eyes are wet with rain
Misty morning rain help me keep smiling
When we say goodbye in misty morning rain

I couldn't bear to watch as she was packing
All her soft things our last bottle of champaigne
I knew right then our party was all over
And goodbye would be a misty morning rain

Misty morning rain please keep on falling...

She almost saw me crying at the airport
When she asked me would I walk her to the plain
And it was raining even hearder but I kissed her
For the last time in the misty morning rain

Misty morning rain please keep on falling...
When we say goodbye in misty morning rain
