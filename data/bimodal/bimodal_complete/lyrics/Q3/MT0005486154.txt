The cats are in the flower bed. a red hawk rides the sky
I guess I should be happy just to be alive
But we have poisoned everything and oblivious to it all
The cell phone zombies babble through the shopping malls

While condors fall from Indian skies
Whales beach and die in sand
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan

You cannot be trusted, do you even know you're lying?
It's dangerous to kid yourself, you go deaf and dumb and blind
You take with such entitlement, you give bad attitude
You have no grace, no empathy, no gratitude

You have no sense of consequence
Oh, my head is in my hands
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan

Before that altering apple, we were one with everything
No sense of self and other, no self-consciousness
But now we have to grapple with our man-made world backfiring
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness

Everyone's a victim, nobody's hands are clean
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth so near the jaws of our machines
We live in these electric scabs, these lesions once were lakes
No one knows how to shoulder the blame or learn from past mistakes

So who will come to save the day?
Mighty Mouse, Superman?
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan
