So many horse and buggies was standin' around
So many horse and buggies was a-standin' around
Waitin' to take my baby to the buryin' ground

When they take his baby to the buryin' ground
He went to the preacher and put his hand on the preacher's shoulder

"You done taken my baby to the buryin' ground
You done taken my baby to the buryin' ground
You done break my heart Lord, when you let her down"

He goes to the head board as her body was goin' home
And fell down on his knees
And here' what he said to his baby

Yes he went to the head board, fell down on his knees
Ah, he went to the head board, fell down on his knees
If you would speak one word babe, give my heart some ease

He goes back home to get him a bucket of water
And he goes to the well

You don't miss your water, 'til your well goes dry
Ah, miss your water, 'til your well goes dry
You don't miss pretty mama, shake your hand goodbye

He goes back home, wanders 'round in the yard

Don't your house look lonesome when your woman done gone
Don't your house look lonesome when your woman done gone
I a-feel mistreated, but I won't let on
