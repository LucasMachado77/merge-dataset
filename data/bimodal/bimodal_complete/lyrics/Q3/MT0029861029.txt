I'll give you my money, what more can i do.
You's a good little girl, lord but you won't be true.

Everyday, my mom, loves and i draw my pay.
You's a evil hearted woman, get drunk and throw it away.

Now you doggin' me mama, ain't did a thing to you.
And you keep on doggin' no telling what i'll do.

Now you dog me every morning, give me the devil late at night.
Just the way you doggin' me, i ain't goin' treat you right.

Hey hey, hey hey, hey aw shucks.
Used to be your regular, now i got to be your dog.

Then i'll be your dog, if you don't dog me around.
Before i'll take your dog and woman, i'll go from town to town.

Now the way, treat blind boy fuller, give me bunch of lies.
And i'll give you my lovin' lord, 'til the day i die.

When you see me coming, throw your man out doors.
Said, i ain't no stranger, i've been here before
