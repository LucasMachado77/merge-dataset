Put it off until tomorrow, whoa whoa
You've hurt me enough today.

You say our love is over
That you have found another
You say you're going away
but leave me tomorrow whoa, whoa
You've hurt me enough today.
You've hurt me enough today
I can't believe the words that you say
I must accept the fact
You won't be coming back.
So stay just one more day
Loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow, whoa, whoa
You've hurt me enough today.

Put it off until tomorrow, whoa, whoa
You've hurt me enough today.
