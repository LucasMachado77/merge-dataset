I must have brought the bad weather with me
The sky's the color of lead
All you left me was a feather
On an unmade bed

It's always me whenever there's trouble
The world does nothing but turn
And the ring, it fell off my finger
I guess I never learn

And it's over, it's over, it's over
I'm getting dressed in the dark
Our story ends before it begins
I always confess to everyone's sins
The nail gets hammered down
And it's over, let it go
So don't go and make a big deal out of nothing
It's just a storm on a dime
And I've always found there's nothing
That money cannot buy

I've already gone to the place that I'm going
There's no place left to fall
Now there's something to be said
About sayin' nothing at all

'Cause baby, then it's over, it's over
It's done, forgotten and through
The story ends before it begins
I always confess to everyone's sins
The nail gets hammered down
And it's over, let it go

You got to let me go
I'm gonna let it go
I wanna let it go
I wanna let you go
I wanna let you go
