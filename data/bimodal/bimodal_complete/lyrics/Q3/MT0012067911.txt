t serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer, suffer
It serves me right to be alone, alone
Because the life I'm living
I'm living in memories gone by

Now watch this now

Every time I see another woman
She makes me think of mine
Think of mine
She makes me think of mine
Think of mine
And that's why I wanna see another woman
Folks, I just can't keep and trying
Keep and trying
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to be alone
Because I'm trying to live my life
And the days of memories gone by
Now I want you to pick upon this
Your delirious is something else
This did this
My doctor put me on
Milk, cream and alcohol, and alcohol
My doctor wrote me a description
For milk, cream and alcohol
My nerve was so bad
I couldn't rest
I couldn't sleep all at the night
And that's why you place me on
Milk, cream and alcohol
You place me on
Milk, cream and alcohol
Even now
I can't lay down and rest at night
Milk, cream and alcohol
