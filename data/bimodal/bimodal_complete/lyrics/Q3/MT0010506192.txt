Dave Bartholomew and Pearl King
As sung by Smiley Lewis.

Well, I got a little girl. She's quiet when she's with me,
But when I'm not around, she's busy as can be.
Oh, still water, still water, yes, you know, that it run deep, oh, yes.

Yes, she can tell, well, some real pretty lies,
But she cannot look me straight in the eyes.
Oh, still water, yes, you know that it run deep, oh, yes.

One night as I lay sleepin' with one eye open,
Yes, I caught her sneakin', sneakin' out the front door.
Yes, still water, oh, you know that it run deep. Oh, yes, it run deep.

Well, everybody knows ... all my trouble
But I been hurt so bad, sometime I think I'm seein' double.
Oh, still water, still water, you know that it run deep, oh, run deep.
