It was always through a falls by a narrow
That I heard a cry I ever shall remember
The fire sent and cast its burning embers
On another fated city of our land

Fire, fire, I heard the cry
From every breeze that passes by
All the world was one sad cry of pity
Strong men in angry praise
Calling loud to Heaven for aid
While the fire in ruin was laying
Fair Baltimore, the beautiful city

Amid an awful struggle of commotion
The wind blew a gale from the ocean
Brave firemen struggled with devotion
But they after all proved in vain
