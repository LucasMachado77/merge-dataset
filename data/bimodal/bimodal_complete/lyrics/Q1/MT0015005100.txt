It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
Refill the cup with my baby tonight
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
Refill the cup with my baby tonight
But I ain't up to my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot

I'd like to cool with my baby tonight
And pitch the wool with my baby tonight
I'd like to cool with my baby tonight
And pitch the wool with my baby tonight
But brother you'll fight my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
According to the latest report
Ev'ry average man you know
Much prefers his lovely doggie to court
When the temperature is low
But when the thermometer goes 'way up
And the weather is sizzling hot

Mister pants
For romance
Is not
'Cause it's too, too
Too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too
Too
Darn hot..

Mister gob, for his squab
A marine, for his queen
A G.I, for his cutypie
Is not
'Cause it's too, too
Too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too
Darn
Hot..
It's too darn hot!
