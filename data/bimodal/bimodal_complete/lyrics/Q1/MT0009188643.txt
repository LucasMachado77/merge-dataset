They say love is blind
But right before my eyes
When I look you on a date last night
And to my surprise
You were staring in the eyes
The eyes of another man
How could you fall in love so fast
Is this a boyfriend
From your past

Who's that dude
I've got an attitude
I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know
Who's that dude
I've got an attitude
Oh baby I'm not so crazy

Don't believe the hype
That I won't make a fight
Though jealousy is not my style oh no
I guess your ways are set
To give me no respect
On the streets I leave you to run wild
How could you fall in love so fast
Is this a boyfriend
From your past

Who's that dude
I've got an attitude
I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know
Who's that dude
I've got an attitude
Oh baby I'm not so crazy

Is an old flame come to light your fire

Is this your idea of having fun
Well I'm telling you
You doing wrong
What's the matter with you

Who's that dude
I've got an attitude
I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know
Who's that dude
I've got an attitude
Oh baby I'm not so crazy

Who's that dude
Cause I've got an attitude
Is he an old flame
Come to light your fire
Satisfy your hearts desire
