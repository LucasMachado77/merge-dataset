In the mornin' I pack up my gear
And toss it in my carryall
Run the wide load to lip an'
Watch the big core crack an' glow

In the evening I undo my belt
Split open and melt

I wake up on my stomach
With my face between my hands
And crawl along the floor
Towards the doorway

Jumpin' to my feet
I try to pull myself together
But I feel it in my knees
And the room begins to spin
And I slip and bump my head
An' raise a welt
Split open and melt

We breathe deep in a steam dream
And plunge below the water line
Down down down melt

Between beams to the gloom room
Among the seaweed and the slime
Down down down melt
