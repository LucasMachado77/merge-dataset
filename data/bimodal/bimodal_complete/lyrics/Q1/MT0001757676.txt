He's a barstool cowboy from old Barstow
And the bar room is his range
His hitchin' post is the old brass rail
And he'll rustle a drink with your change

Oh his horse is rye, and he sure rides high
When he gets a drink or two
He's a barstool cowboy from old Barstow
And his brand is an I.O.U.

When the last round up's in order
And the boys stampede for the bar
He's nearly south of the border
But he'll rope 'em in for just one more

He's a barstool cowboy from old Barstow
And the bar room is his range
His hitchin' post is the old brass rail
If he can rustle a drink with your change
He's home, home on the range.
