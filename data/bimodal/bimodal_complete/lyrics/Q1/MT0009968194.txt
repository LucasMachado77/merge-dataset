Twenty-five minutes past quitting time
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Paying no attention to them highway signs
Ninety mile an hour toward the county line

Quick sack, twelve pack, back again

Its a B - double E - double R - U - N

My buddies and their babies lettin' down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing that the fun is in the gettin' there

Aztec, long necks, paycheck spent

Its a B - double E - double R - U - N

I can't stop thinkin' what the Hell they were drinkin'
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst and to make it worse
Lord its my turn to drive

Oh, laughin' and a braggin' and a carryin' on
We loaded up the wagons and we're headin' home
I guess half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone

And its turn around, leave town, sounds again

Its a B - double E - double R - U - N
Its a B - double E - double R - U - N
