Drop that long face!
C'mon have your fling
Why keep nursing the blues?
If you want this whole world on a swing
Put on your dancing shoes
Stop wasting time
Put on your dancing shoes
Watch your spirits climb

Shall we dance
Or keep on moping?
Shall we dance
Or walk on air?
Shall we give in
To despair
Or shall we dance with never a care
Life is short
We're getting older
Don't you be
An also-ran
You better dance little lady
Dance little man
Dance whenever you can
