I'm swept away
Yes I'm off the ground flyin
Swept away
Yesterday's all but gone
Like a hurricane
You are tossin me round
Find I'm swept away
And today you're the one

For society
Shimmy shimmy shimmy
And you go
Oh no
For propriety
Shimmy shimmy shimmy
And you go
No no
But now I'm swept away
Yes I'm past the sound barrier
Swept away
Yesterday's all but done
Like a novocain
Shootin up through my arm faster
Swept away
And today you're the one

For society
Shimmy shimmy shimmy
And you go
Oh no
For propriety
Shimmy shimmy shimmy
And you go
No no

But now I'm swept away
Yes I'm past the sound barrier
Swept away
Yesterday's all but done
Like election day
You are robbin me blind mister
Swept away
And today you're the one
