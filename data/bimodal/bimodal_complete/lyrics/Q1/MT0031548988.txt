Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

It's finger pop poppin' time
Finger poppin', poppin' time
I feel so good
Woo and that's a real good sign

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

Baby, come along with me
Hey
Hey, hey baby, come along with me
We gonna shake it 'til it breaks
Just wait and see

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
It's finger pop poppin' time
Finger poppin', poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

Here comes Mary, here comes Sue
A-here comes Johnny and Bobby too

It's finger pop poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

Here comes Mary, here comes Sue
here comes Johnny and Bobby too

It's finger pop poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
It's finger pop poppin' time
Finger poppin', poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

Poppin', Finger poppin'
Finger poppin'
Finger poppin', poppin'
Finger poppin', poppin'
