Bow to the fiddler
Don't be slow
Smoke on the mountain
Fire on the bow

Pick out the tunewe
Love to hear
Patch up the feelin's
Mend all the fear

Oh, what a showdown
Toe to toe
First one to holler
Last one to go
Now change your partners
Clap your hands
Stomp your feet
At the new barn dance

Ooh, stealin'
Colorado reelin'
Rocky Mountain Breakdown
