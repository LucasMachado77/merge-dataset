Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your loves still strong
Ooh, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

In that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh, baby, here I am signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed, yeah)

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean (Wrap me up.)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, didn't I, oh, baby (C'mon.)

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl
Ooh, baby, here I am,
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, oh, I'm yours

Oo-wee, babe, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my heart's only desire
Ooh, baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am, baby (Unwrap me, baby.)
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(Got the future in your hand.)
Here I am, baby (Unwrap me, baby.)
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(Got the future in your hand.)

Hold my hand, let me know you can
Hold my hand, let me know you can
Tell me what you want me to do

Hold my hand let me know you can
Here I am, baby, baby (That's right.)
Hold my hand let me know you can

Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am, baby (Unwrap me, baby.)
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am, pretty baby (Where you at?)
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, pretty baby (Sing to me now.)

Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed, delivered)

Sing a little more
Baby, baby, bay
Here I am, pretty baby

Blue, Angie Stone, Stevie
That'll work
