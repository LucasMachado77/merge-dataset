Dancing is a world
Our preference one on one
Having fun
'Til night is done
You say I'm the man to make our love begin
Ooh tell me when
We start again
I took for granted love you see
You made the love tender to me
Love me, love me now
Dancing in a world I had to check you out
Your love somehow
Just blew me out
All up in your like a fantasy
Ooh come dance with me
Come dance with me
Do I give myself away
Make the time and call today
Love me, love me now

Dancing with a girl she make an appetite
Like apple pie
Her body's ripe
People everywhere seem to be amazed
Ooh your sexy grace
Your tender face
Plus a calm a different kind
Loving ways will seem to find
Love me, love me now

Love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Took for granted love you see
Love me, love me now

To you I'd give myself away
Love me, love me now
Love me, love me
Do do doo do do
Baby so in love with you
Love me, love me now

Love me, love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
Love me, love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Love me, love me baby
Come love again
You need your man
Just tell me when
We groove again
Love me, love me baby
Love me, love me baby
Like apple pie, under the night
The moon is right, I'm through tonight
Love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
I'm on your vibes
All in your eyes
Your sensuous ways
They hypnotize
Love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Love me, love me baby
Love me, love me, love me baby
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
