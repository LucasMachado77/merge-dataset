All the times I've wasted baby, be my steady date
I wanna make up for lost time tonight and I just can't wait
Put your lips to mine with your kiss of fire, woah yeah
Just to be with you baby tonight is my one desire
All the times I've wasted baby, be my steady date
I wanna make up for lost time tonight and I just can't wait
Put your lips to mine with your kiss of fire, woah yeah
Just to be with you baby tonight is my one desire
Just to be with you baby tonight is my one desire
