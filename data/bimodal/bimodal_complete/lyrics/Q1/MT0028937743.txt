You'd better run, you'd better hide
You'd better lock your house and keep the kids inside
Here come the 20th century's latest scam
He's a half a boy and half a man

He ain't a fool, but he's a tool
Because his left don't know what his right hand's doin'
He'd keep a King Kong eating out the palm of his hand
He's a half a boy and half a man

Best be fleet, upon your feet
Else the S.P.G.'s gonna be clearin' the streets
They never made no provision in the original plan for
Half a boy and half a man

When his fingers do the walking
In the middle of the night
Well, when his people stalk in
Baby, let me tell you
Nothing come out right

Best be fleet, upon your feet
Else the S.P.G.'s gonna be clearin' the streets
They never made no provision in the original plan for
Half a boy and half a man

Oh, when his fingers do the walking
In the middle of the night
Well, when his people stalk in
Baby, let me tell you
Nothing come out right

You'd better run, you'd better hide
You'd better lock your house and keep the kids inside
Here come the 20th century's latest scam
He's a half a boy and half a man

He's a half a boy and half a man
He's a half a boy and half a man
He's a half a boy and half a man
Come on!
