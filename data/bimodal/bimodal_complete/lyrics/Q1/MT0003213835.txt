Boy what have you done for me 
I've been going down on you 
You not going down on me 
Girl that's how a rude boy plays
I don't have to take you there
I can please you in other ways 

Across the hall neighbors hear the sound 
Mr. lover Lover in town 
Carpet burns from being on the ground 
Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan 
Oh dawn the phone 
Baby don't stop Yeah you like that Simone
Champion lover the best pound for pound
Take you to the clouds without going downtown 

Why why don't you just change your ways 
Won't you open up your mind 
Boy we're living in modern days

Girl I'm coming from the school
Where if you want the job done right 
You have to used the proper tool 
You never been love until you've been filled 
Filled full of pleasure from a rude boy's skill
Passion and ecstasy you know the drill
Full up your cup till your juice's spill
Leave the door open just for the thrill
Now we're at the point where you can't keep still
Covered in sweat but feeling the chill
That's the effect of a lover man's pill 

Tell me why you want to tease me (baby)
Don't you want to please me 
Why you holding back when I know what's on you mind

Across the hall neighbors hear the sound 
Mr. lover Lover in town 
Carpet burns from being on the ground 
Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan 
Oh dawn the phone 
Baby don't stop Yeah you like that Simone
Champion lover the best pound for pound
Take you to the clouds without going downtown
