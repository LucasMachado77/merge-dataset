Well look, see, there's an abominable snowman in the supermarket
And apparently the housewives have never seen anything like that before
Hear the housewives complaing to the manager
"Get that snow thing out of this store."

Abominable snowman in the market
That's right, you heard me right, gang
And the housewives, they all remarking
"Looks like a dirty marshmallow with fangs."
Well, there's an abominable snowman in the market
Now he's down by the peas and carrots
Abominable snowman in the market
And they cannot chase him away

Abominable snowman in the market
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Abominable snowman in the market
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

See, there's an abominable snowman in the market
And the situation is grave
Well, the housewives hurt and confuse him
And I can't see him treated this way
Well, there's an abominable snowman in the market
And I think he's a real nice guy
I like the snowman, I want to help him out
I don't want to see him hurt this way

And we have to say something that he can understand

There's an abominable snowman in the market
And he's doin' better every day
I know it's helped him to have a more tolerant feeling
And I like to see him treated this way
Well, there's an abominable snowman in the market
And he's down by the peas and carrots
