I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

I love you
'Cause you mean everything to me and I
I love you
I thank you for just being in my life
I love you
I love the way you can always make me smile
I love you
And wherever I go, you're always in my heart

Nobody ever bring the joy you bring to me
You make me feel the way you do
And there ain't nothing like your love
That sometimes makes you stop and think like
Do I deserve such a love that can now move heaven and earth
For my lovin' I could never surround my life without the things
That you provide ever since you came into my life
And it feels like my whole world is happening
I can't stress how much I've been blessed
See what you came and done to me
You make my life complete
I know sometimes I might forget
That even when I don't say it
You know that I mean it I

I love you
'Cause you mean everything to me and I
I love you
I thank you for just being in my life
I love you
I love the way you can always make me smile
I love you
And wherever I go, you're always in my heart

See I dont minding wake up everyday and see your face
And wanting to lay inside your arms
Cause there ain't nothing like your touch
It's so good never seems like enough
I didn't know that a love could grow and take over your soul
Dont advise much more
Only when you're apart if feels like living life is hard
Your entire world just seems so dark
Then it lights up 'cause you are my shining star
And I don't know what I'd do without you

See what you came and done to me
You make my life complete
I know sometimes I might forget
But even when I don't say it
You know that I mean it I

I love you
'Cause you mean everything to me and I
I love you
I thank you for just being in my life
I love you
I love the way you can always make me smile
I love you
And wherever I go, you're always in my heart

When you love somebody
You can share everything
Because you understand that you'll be right there
Anytime, any place, anywhere
When you love somebody
You can be only me
If they cry you'll be right by their side
To make everything alright

I love you
'Cause you mean everything to me and I
I love you
I thank you for just being in my life
I love you
I love the way you can always make me smile
I love you
And wherever I go, you're always in my heart
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
'cause you mean everything to me and I
I love you
I thank you for just being in my life
I love you
I love the way you can always make me smile
I love you
And wherever I go you're always in my heart
