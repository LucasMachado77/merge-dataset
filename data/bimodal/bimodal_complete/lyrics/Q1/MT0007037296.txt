We've been through the days of thunder
Some people said we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together and were millions strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there from the start)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

Everyone, everyone, everyone
So this one goes out to you
Everyone
We're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We took the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around we'll always stay the same, oh, yeah

Let's get on with the show
(Oh, let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
We know who you are

Everyone, everyone, everyone
So this one goes out to you
Everyone
We're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

We, we're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you

Everyone, everyone, everyone
So this one goes out to you
Everyone
We're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

Everyone, everyone, everyone
So this one goes out to you
Everyone
We're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you
