Do the things you do ( a woman like you)

Never had a woman
That had a heart of gold
A mind of steel
Rock my soul with her sex appeal
Run her nails up and down my thighs
She's the essence of my pride
She sets the fire in my bed
She's the neck that turns my bed
She's the neck that turns my head
Woman that makes feel like a king
For her, I'll do mot anything
