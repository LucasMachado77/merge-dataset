Band!

When I was 17, I did what people told me, uhh!
I did what my father said, and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago
I'm in

Control
Never gonna stop
Control
To get what I want
Control
I like to have a lot
Control
Now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love, I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive, I thought it would be easy
Now I know I got to take

Control
Now I've got a lot
You sing!
Control
To get what I want
Control
Never gonna stop
Control
Now I'm all grown up

Jam, ooh-ooh
Rebel, that's right
I'm on my own, I'll call my own shots
Thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand, and lead you in this dance
Control
It's what I got, because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world, just wanna run my life
Ooh
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance, just take...

Control
You know it
Now I got a lot
You sing!
Control
That's right
To get what I want
One time
Control
Never gonna stop
Control
Now I'm all grown up

Ooh
Free at last
Out here on my own
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, eee
Now control this, uhh

Get with it!
Ooh!
Terry!
Break it down!
Right here!
Jimmy Jam!

I've got my own mind
Ooh baby
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I'm gonna be the one in control

Hop to it
I'm in control
And I love it
That's right
You sing it
Control
Now I got a lot
Sing
Control
Now I'm all grown up
Ow!
I'm in control
Now you sing
I'm in control
Sounds good!

Ow!
