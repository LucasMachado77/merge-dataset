We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up, everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up, everybody and sing

Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by (And)
And we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie (All)

All of the people around us they say
"Can they be that close?"
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up, everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up, everybody and sing
Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of the world's delights (High)
High hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight (We)

No, we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong, oh no, this is our family Jewel

We are family (Heyey, sing it to me!)
I got all my sisters with me (Get up and sing it with me)
We are family (Ah, I can't hear you all)
Get up, everybody and sing (Oooh)

We are family (Have faith in you and the things you do, hey, hey)
I got all my sisters with me (Oh, heyheyhey, hey)
We are family (Get up, get up!)
Get up, everybody and sing
