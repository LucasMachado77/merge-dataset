Darling, if you ever leave me
Well, I'll just put my heart away
I couldn't love again, believe me
No one could please me anyway
And if another ever came along
I'd just turn them down 'cause after all

I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top, I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin' less
I've been loved by the best
If you ever get tired of me
Well, I won't look for someone new
'Cause looking back on how you loved me
No one could measure up to you
And if they try to win this heart of mine
I just have to say, a waste if time

I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top, I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin' less
I've been loved by the best

When I look into your eyes I know
You're the only love I ever want
'Cause, after you and me
Baby, I can see
Nothin' else could be even close

I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin less
I've been loved by the best...
