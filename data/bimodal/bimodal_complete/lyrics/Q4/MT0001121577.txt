Over time You've healed so much in me,
And I am living proof.
That although my darkest hour had come,
Your light could still shine through.
Though at times it's just enought to cast,
A shadow on the wall.
I am grateful that you've shined your light on me at all.

Who Am I,
That you would love me so gently?
Who Am I,
That you would recognize my name?
Who Am I,
That you would speak to me so softly?
Conversation with the Lord most high.
Who Am I?

Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost,
But now am found.
Was blind,
But now I see.
And the more I sing that sweet old song,
The more I understand.
That I do not comprehend this love that's coming from your hand.

Who Am I,
That you would love me so gently?
Who Am I,
That you would recognize my name?
Who Am I,
That you would speak to me so softly?
Conversation with the Lord most high.
Who Am I?

Grace, grace.
God's grace.
Grace that will pardon, and cleanse within.
Grace, grace.
God's great grace.
Grace that is greater than all my sin.

Who Am I,
That you would love me so gently?
Who Am I,
That you would recognize my name?
Who Am I,
That you would speak to me so softly?
Conversation with the Lord most high.
Who Am I?

Lord, Who Am I?
Who Am I?
Lord Who Am I?
Who Am I?
Who Am I?
