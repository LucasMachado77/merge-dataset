The makeup you wear
When your doing your eyes
The sway of your dress
When you walk has me hypnotized
The touch of your legs
When we're laying in bed
The touch of your hand
When you gently rub my head

You hold a special place in this Heart of Mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine
You hold a special place in this Heart of mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine

The smell of your hair
When I'm holding you close
The sound of voice
When we're on the telephone
The way that you look
In your sexy Lingerie
The way that you kiss me in that special way

You hold a special place in this Heart of Mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine
You hold a special place in this Heart of mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine

You hold a special place in this Heart of Mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine
You hold a special place in this Heart of mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine

You hold a special place in this Heart of Mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine
You hold a special place in this Heart of mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine

You hold a special place in this Heart of Mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine
You hold a special place in this Heart of mine
You hold a special place I call Love Divine
