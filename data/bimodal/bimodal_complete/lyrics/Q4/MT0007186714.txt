The two of us together 
Makes the two of us just fools
After saying goodbye to each other
Here we are breaking every rule

I said I didn't care about you 
You said the same about me
You said that you could live without me 
I said I'd rather be free

Now here we are together 
Saying how we've been so blue
The two of us together 
Are we in love or we just two fools

I said I didn't care about you 
You said the same about me
You said that you could live without me 
I said I'd rather be free

Are we in love or we just two fools
