Go to sleep, you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's the hobo's lullaby

I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning gray
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find peace and rest some day

Go to sleep, you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's the hobo's lullaby

Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

So, go to sleep, you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's the hobo's lullaby

I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to heaven
There'll be no policemen there
Go to sleep, you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's the hobo's lullaby
