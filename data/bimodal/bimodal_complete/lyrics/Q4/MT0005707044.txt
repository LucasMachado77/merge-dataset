Yo, I've got a little story that I'd like to address
To individuals, gotta get it off my chest
It ain't about who's the best
Or Five being better than the next
We're just a little different from the rest
'cause see, we got each other
When things go down
And time is just too important to be messin around
So understand not what I'm trying to say
But appreciate living life day to day

So how does it feel to be the only ones
Left out in the rain 'cause you're phony ones
Wake up and realize what you live is a dream
Ain't gonna be there for long even though it may seem
Like a never ending story
You in it for the money or the glory
Open up your ears or ignore me
All I'm tryin' to do is be the man I am and be the best in this world I can

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin' on
Gotta keep movin' on

You got to open your mind up and kick both your feet up
I'll hit you with a tale of how the five of us were meet up
We're just five guys who want to rise to the skies
No, we got a vision in our eyes
Now people want to step up and try to hold us back
They want to try to stop us getting freaky on this track
But this is how we kick it and this is how we swing
And this is how I hit you with the funk that I bring
Now you gotta select to connect not disrespect
And you gotta learn to keep your negativity in check
'cause everybody knows what goes around comes around
I'll put it down with my sound

Reminiscing bout' the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on
