Wherever we go, whatever we do,
We're gonna go through it together.
We may not go far, but sure as a star,
Wherever we are, it's together.

Wherever I go I know he goes.
Wherever I go I know she goes.
No fits, no fights, no feuds
And no egos, Amigos, together!

Through thick and through thin,
All out or all in.
And whether it's win, place or show.
With you for me and me for you,
We'll muddle through whatever we do.
Together, wherever we go.

Wherever we go, whatever we do,
We're gonna go through it together.
Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep,
We'll always sleep cheaper together.

Whatever the boat I row, you row.
A duo
Whatever the row I hoe, you hoe.
A trio.
And any I. O. U., I owe you-oh's?
Who, me-oh? No, you-oh.
No, we-oh.
Together!

We all take the bow
Including the cow,
Though business is lousy and slow.
With Herbie's vim, Louise's verve,
Now all we need is someone with nerve.
Together
Together
Wherever
Wherever
Together, wherever,
Together, wherever we go.

We go in a group,
We tour in a troupe.
We land in the soup, but we know
The things we do, we do by threes.
A perfect team.
Rose: No, this way, Louise!
Together
Together
Wherever
Wherever
Together, wherever we go!
