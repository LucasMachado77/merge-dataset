Loving you was
Always a cost
That I never bought
Till we
Start drifting apart
Now I find the loving you give
Is something I've got to feel

Gotta make comeback
To your heart
I realize
A love that is lost
No greater cost
Than the pain
Of a broken heart

And I know that I've got to pay
Every night and day

Gotta make a comeback
To your heart

Girl when you said
Here's where it ends
Let's just be friends?
And I had to make a start

On a loving campaign
Just to win you back again

Gotta make comeback
To your heart

Gotta make a comeback
