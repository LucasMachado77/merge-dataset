Let me tell you bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every morning fore the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
So I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know shell go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile and tell them she told me so
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

If I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
Tells me every thing will be alright
So why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
