Mistletoe fell on my nose a tear rolled down my cheek
And I've been on a two month tour for almost forty weeks
Well it ain't the shows that get to me or even bein' alone
But it's so close to Christmas and I'm so far from home

There's Santa Claus on every block there's winter in the skies
There's pretty girls with packages and toys in children's eyes
There's spirit and there's atmosphere from New Orleans to Rome
And it's so close to Christmas and I'm so far from home

Lord this roadside music show that just goes on and on
When it's so close to Christmas and I'm so far from home

So I'll make you happy Christmas Day I'll sing 'em soft and warm
But all the while I'm singin' my mind's down on the farm
With momma's homemade Christmas meal and daddy's drunken song
Cause it's so close to Christmas and I'm so far from home

Lord this roadside music show that just goes on and on
When it's so close to Christmas and I'm so far from home
When it's so close to Christmas and I'm so far from home
