Oh, Christmas time, oh, time of joy
A wondrous day for each girl and boy
The fire is warm and the spirits bright
What a beautiful sight, it is Christmas

Raise up your voice and sing
Fill the room with joy
Let the laughters ring
Sing out with word and rhyme
It's a wonderful time
It is Christmas

The children gathered around the tree
How they look and wonder and laugh with glee
Their hearts are filled with a hundred dreams
And they're counting the moments 'til Christmas

Raise up your voice and sing
Fill the room with joy
Let the laughters ring
Sing out with word and rhyme
It's a wonderful time
It is Christmas

Come sit you down and leave your pill
It's a time for happiness and good will
May all good thoughts and dreams come true
And we wish you all Merry Christmas

Raise up your voice and sing
Fill the room with joy
Let the laughter's ring
Sing out with word and rhyme
It's a wonderful time
It is Christmas
