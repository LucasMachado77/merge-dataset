O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Saviour's birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

Oh, night divine
Oh, night when Christ was born

Oh night divine
Oh night
Oh, night divine

(Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Saviour's birth)
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us
Praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord
The name forever praise we
Oh, (unintelligible-Italian?)
Oh night, oh night divine

Oh night
Divine
Oh night
Oh, holy night
