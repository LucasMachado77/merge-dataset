If you can dream
The world's a better place by far
If you can dream
You're anyone you dream you are

Day or night
You've the right to pretend
Close your eyes
Each surprise is yours, my friend

If you can dream
The love you seek is by your side
If you can dream
His kiss will leave you starry-eyed
Castles and kings
Are everyday things, there's no extreme
If you can dream
And just believe the things you dream

If you can dream
The love you seek is by your side
If you can dream
His kiss will leave you starry-eyed

Castles and kings
Are everyday things, there's no extreme
If you can dream
And just believe the things you dream
