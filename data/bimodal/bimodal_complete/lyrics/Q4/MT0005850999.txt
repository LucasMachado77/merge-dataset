Why should I bend down my head and cry?
Why should I bend down my head and cry?

The old world has ended (who's got the whole world now)
The new world has just begun
And all them people that live therein (still in the new world now)
Shall live on and on
One more thing:

Got to get what I need
Got to get what I want
Got to get what I need
Got to get what I want

Got to get satisfaction
Got to get the action
Got love and affection
One more thing:

Once there was two roads before us (who's got the whole world now)
To pick our choice
But good has overcome bad
The sheep has heard their master's voice
So tell me why:

Why should I bend down my head and cry?
No reason why
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
Got to move, got to groove
Got to get what I want, what did you say?
Got to get it
Got to get what I need
Got to get what I want
Like I say, got to get it
Got to get what I need...satisfaction

The old world has ended (who's got the whole world now)
The new world has just begun
And all them people that live therein (still in the new world now)
Shall live on and on
One more thing:

Why should I bend down my head and cry?
My father is a king
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
All the riches in the earth
So tell me why
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
