The clouds spell apocalypse
The clouds smell the politics
I meet so many people, i gave up on names
I figure that's okay 'cause i just call everyone "man" anyway
Rollin' over, rollin' over
Returning to the dream
Rollin' over, rollin' over
Returning to a dream
With the earth agree to circle any and all points
Can each be the center simultaneously
Our work continues ending to infinite variable speeds
