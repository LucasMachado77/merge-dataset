Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come

Two of us have a little fuss
Ev'rything you draw your last
Ev'rything you run for your gun
Ev'rything you fling rock stone
Hear this!

Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
Drop them !

A no ignorance he do it
A no brute force do it
Your weapons can't do it
So hear this !
Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
Drop them
Put them away to stay

Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
I long to see you
I long to reason with you
I long to hold your hands in my hands
Can't you see
Can't you see?

Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
Throw down your arms and come
