The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That anyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of a daydream
I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow
The moments go till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
And your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

I'm living in a kind of a daydream
I'm happy, I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow
The moments go till I am near to you

I see your face in every flower
And your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
My love, my love
