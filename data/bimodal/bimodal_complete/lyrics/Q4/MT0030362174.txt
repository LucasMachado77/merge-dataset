Love should mean so much
But the only kind I've touched was incomplete
Till the moment I found you
That's the moment that I knew

There's someone like me
Who still believes some things are meant to be
Someone who needs forever someone like you
Holdin' onto the same dream I've been dreamin' of
Someone who still believes in love

So here you are at last
We can feel what's come to pass is here to stay
World can come & go
It won't matter 'cause I know

There's someone like me
Who still believes some things are meant to be
Someone who needs forever someone like you
Holdin' onto the same dream I've been dreamin' of
Someone who still believes in love

Someone like you
Holdin' onto the same dream I've been dreamin' of
Someone who still believes in love
Someone who still believes in love
