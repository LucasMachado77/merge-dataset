Talk to me, talk to me
Darling, I love every thing you say
Talk to me, talk to me
In your own sweet gentle way

Let me hear, tell me dear
Tell me you, tell me you love me so
Talk to me, talk to me baby
Darling I, I want to know

The many ways you speak of love
I heard before
And it sounds so good every time
Please say the part, I love you once more
Whatever may crawl, you're mine

Talk to me, talk to me
Hold me tight, hold me close, whisper low
Talk to me, talk to me baby
Darling I, I love you so

The many ways you speak of love
I heard before
And it sounds so good every time
Please say the part, I love you once more
Whatever may crawl, you're mine
