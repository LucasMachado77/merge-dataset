Today can be gladness, mister, you don't know
Tomorrow can be sadness, sister, you don't know
What makes the world go around, round an' round?
You never know, you don't know

So save a bread, mister, save it for the future
Save a bread, sister, because things will be better
You know not the minute nor the hour, man shall come
You know not the minute nor the hour, the time is now

What you know, you know
And what you don't know, you don't know
The greatest thing is to know
That what you don't know, you don't know
Anywhere you go
What you don't know, you don't know

Today can be gladness, mister, you don't know
Tomorrow can be sadness, sister, you don't know
What makes the world go around, round an' round?
You'll never know, you don't know

So save a bread, mister, save it for the future
Save a bread, sister, because things will be better
You know not the minute nor the hour, man shall come
You know not the minute nor the hour, the time is now

What you know, you know
And what you don't know, you don't know
The greatest thing is to know
That what you don't know, you don't know
Anywhere you go
What you don't know, you don't know
