Before we go to sleep tonight
We'll say our prayers
I'll hold you tight
And kiss away the fears you hold inside you

So many years have passed us by
I cherish the moments by your side
A love like ours will only grow much stronger
I wanna to tell you

That forever more I'll be the one to love you, to love you
When you need me I'll be there to make you smile
And forever more I'll be the one you come to oh honey
I'll be the one to love you when the morning comes

Through all the tears we left behind
The joy we shared, your hand in my mine
I can't resist ooo touching you not even while you're sleeping
And when you wake I promise you
We'll celebrate our dreams come true
A love like ours will only grown much stronger

I wanna to tell you
That forever more I'll be the one to love you, to love you
When you need me I'll be there to make you smile
And forever more I'll be the one you come to oh baby
I'll be the one to love you when the morning comes

Let me tell you
There will never be another cold and lonely winter night
'Cause we're family
And baby our love will last forever

So I'll say to you
That forever more, I'll be the one to love you darling
When you need me I'll be there to make you smile
And forever more I'll be the one you come to oh I will baby
I'll be the one to love you when the morning comes
I'll be the one to love you... forever more
