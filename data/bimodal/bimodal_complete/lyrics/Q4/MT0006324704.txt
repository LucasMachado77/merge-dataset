Once upon a time
Not so long ago
We walked hand in hand
Strangers smiled hello

Dancin' until dawn
Flowers in your hair
Magic music played
Love was everywhere

Then a dragon came, cast a spell on you
Stole your heart away
Struck me to the Earth
All the flowers died
And the sky turned gray
Your heart's my home my kingdom and my destiny
This knight in shining armour's gonna set you free
I gotta make our fairy tale end happily
Ever after
Ever after

Couldn't sleep last night
Panic and despair
Tortured by that coarse evil in the air

What can I do
Where are you now
I was naIve, I couldn't see
The danger there, I was deceived

Your heart's my home my kingdom and my destiny
This knight in shining armour's gonna set you free
I gotta make our fairy tale end happily
Ever after
Ever after

I'll help you fight
Take back control
Reverse that curse
And free your soul
Free your soul
Free your soul
Been a thousand years since I saw your face
Cried a million tears, ached for your embrace
Gonna search the realm-gonna rescue you
Shake you from that trance
I'll slay that dragon
Save my prince's queen
And win you with romance

Your heart's my hope, my kingdom and my destiny
This knight in shining armour's gonna set you free
I gotta make our fairy tale end happily
