My brethren whom I love so well
When we where all such sufferers
There was an old tattoo
That He made I
To cover I shelterless head
Way down in the gully

'Cause there was an old tattoo
That He made I
To cover I shelterless head
-But hear wha' him do
One day, while we were gone away
To chant Jah Holy Word

Me seh Him tear down the old tattoo
That he made I
To cover I shelterless head
We are all children of Africa and the Most High
Him shake down the old tattoo
That he made I
To cover I shelterless head
Sad news, fresh!

What a pain to my heart
Could you imagine that?
The way I feel in sufferation
Do you think I would have done this to you?
Do you think, my brother
I could have done this to you?

Me seh Him shake down the old tattoo
That He made I
To cover I shelterless head
Feel this for me my brother, yeah
Mi seh Him shake down the old tattoo
That he made I
To cover I shelterless head
Mother and Father feel it and thunder roll

Me seh Him shake down the old tattoo
That He made I
To cover I shelterless head
With Jah gonna move it forward
With and equal rights and love
Me seh Him shake down the old tattoo
That he made I
To cover I shelterless head
We used to praise and give tanks and lick cup together

Him shake down the old tattoo
That He made I
To cover I shelterless head
He 'aint got no mercy on I and I cold nor rain dew
Tear down the old Tattoo..
