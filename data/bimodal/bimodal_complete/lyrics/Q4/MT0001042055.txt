Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan..

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan,
take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand,
rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean.
singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'..

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan.

Well, if you're thinkin' bout getting me a present this year,
let me put a bug in your cute little ear,
How bout two tickets to a tropical shore,
where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore,
instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill,
and Pina Coladas in the blender chillin'..

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan,
take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand,
rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean,
singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'..

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?(its a real good plan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan..

Well everybody's praying for a Christmas so white,
come to think about it, that'd be alright,
as long as it's sand and not snow on the ground,
and everyday our skin gets a little more brown,
We'll string some lights in a coconut tree,
I'll rub some oil on you, and you can rub some on me..

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan,
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand,
rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean..
Baby won't you say you and me we'll be going?
Ooooo, I can almost feel my toes in the sand,(my toes in the sand)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan..

Don't worry baby, we'll celebrate plenty,
I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini..
We won't have to worry about the holiday rush,
it'll be you and me fallin' deeper in love..

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?(its a real good plan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan..
(a real good tan)

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan..
