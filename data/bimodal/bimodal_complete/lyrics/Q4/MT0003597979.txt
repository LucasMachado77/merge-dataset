Well, all you girls think
The days are dawned
You don't have to worry
You can have your fun

Take me, baby
For your little boy
Because three hundred pounds
Of a heavenly joy

This is it, this is it
Look what you get

You've been bending
And hiding 'round behind his back
And you got your man
That you don't like

Throw that Jack, baby
Outta your mind
Follow me, baby
And have a real good time

This is it, this is it
Look what you get

Hoy, hoy
I'm the boy
I've got three hundred pounds
Of a heavenly joy

I'm so glad
That you understand
I'm three hundred pounds
Of muscle and man

This is it, this is it
Look what you get
