Happy I am
All on the new day
Happy I am
People and flowers
Are one in the same
All in a chain
At the beginning of a new world

Someone's singing and I think it's me
Youth is winging and longs to be free
So follow me

Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for me
Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for me

Into your life
There will come friends
Maybe a wife
Who to you sends
Love with no gain
Part of a chain
At the giving birth of a new child

Someone's painting and I think it's me
Someone's living and, oh, gosh, it's me
And so you see

Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for me
Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for me

Happy I am
Roll on the new day
Happy I am
People and flowers
Are one and the same
All in a chain
At the beginning of a new world

Someone's singing and I think it's me
Someone's living and, oh, gosh, it's me
And so you see

Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for me
Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling (so follow me)
Feeling for me
Love is only feeling (so follow me)
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling (so follow me)
Feeling for me
