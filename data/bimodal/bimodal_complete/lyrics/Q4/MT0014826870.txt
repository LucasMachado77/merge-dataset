I'm your director
Its getting deep
We don't need to rent nothing, we'll make our own movies
I'm your director
Its getting deep
We don't need a videotape or a camera
To make this ghetto love scene
Whoo
I wanna welcome everybody here tonight (uh)
Its such a beautiful occasion (yes)
I wanna tell you the way I feel (you know)
This is for the ladies
I wanna take you to a place you've never been before (take you there)
Sit back and enjoy this ride

Our love exploding in the air
Like the works on the 4th of July
Or like the sun how it sits upon the earth
Shine through clouds in the sky
I might never get as much air time
As a pilot would get
But I'm sure right to do things
That we both haven't tried yet
Take a trip to the moon
Just me and you
And we'll shine on the earth
I'll show the world what you're worth

Did ya like that
Tell me
Did ya like that
I just wanna, I just wanna show
So many ways I
Wanna show you what
Take our love to another level
So many ways I
Wanna go to a new paradise
Just one blink of an eye
So many ways I can
And I'll never let you go

Cause this
This message of love is what I'm sending to you
I love you so much there's nothing I wouldn't do
For you, for you
Let me be the reason you come from the floor with nothing but love (??)
Like an orphan at Christmas
Who gets a million toys
Theres no words to explain how it felt when we met
But I
I'll try with this song and see how far I can get
It feels like Heaven
When you're wrapped in my arms, that's what comes over me
It feels like Heaven

I just wanna, I just wanna
So many ways I
Wanna show you what
Take our love to another level
So many ways I
Wanna go to a new paradise
Just one blink of an eye
So many ways I can
And I'll never let you go

Take you to a place far away from here
Go somewhere to erase your fears
And feel free about life, no worries, in your life
Take you to a place far away from here
Go somewhere to erase your fears
Grass is greener on the other side
Just sit back and enjoy this ride

So many ways I (lets go)
Wanna show you what
Take our love to another level (far away)
So many ways I (take a car ride)
Wanna go to a new paradise
Just one blink of an eye (just me and you)
So many ways I can (so many ways)
And I'll never let you go

Ain't nothing stopping us, no (Nothing stopping us)
But space and opportunity, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
