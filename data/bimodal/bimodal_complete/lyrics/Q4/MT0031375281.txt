Born again, free from sin
I'm happy night and day
Makes me shout
There's no doubt
I know I'm born again
Satan tells me that I only thought I got saved
He tells me what a fool I have been
But when my mind goes back to that old place where I've prayed
I know that I've been born again
Born again, free from sin
I'm happy night and day
Makes me shout
There's no doubt
I know I'm born again

Many times along the way my faith has gone weak
When burdens seem to rise on every hand
But when I steal away in prayer He answers my plea
My every need he understands
Born again, free from sin
I'm happy night and day
Makes me shout
There's no doubt
I know I'm born again
