You don't have to have a straight nose, a beautiful smile or a pretty face to be beautiful
God has created us all in his own image, that means we're perfect

I wasn't born with a pretty face, I don't have a super model shape
Got extra pounds hanging from my waist but I'm beautiful... so walk with grace
I don't have a college degree, my family ain't high society
Sometimes I'm broke but I know I'm free, I give god thanks for creating me

I'm not the worlds most prettiest but I turned out fine
I thank the lord cos I'm truly blessed, I'm a star that always shines
You can mark the word, you may not know it yet but my name will live on when I resign
Cos I'm fine, yeah I'm so fine

I don't look like a beauty queen, not like the girls in a magazine
When I smile it's kinda lean but I love myself, if you know what I mean
I never been with a movie star, I don't drive me a fancy car
I got birthmarks and childhood scars but I don't complain cos I'm good so far

I'm not the worlds most prettiest but I turned out fine
I thank the lord cos I'm truly blessed, I'm a star that always shines
You can mark the word, you may not know it yet but my name will live on when I resign
Cos I'm fine, yeah I'm so fine
I'm a beautiful woman, a intriguing woman, a strong, strong woman

I don't always look my best, many days my hair is a mess
Sometimes my lines I do forget but I'm only human I'm not perfect
I got problem and a lot of stress, I work hard to be the best
Many days I need my rest but thank you lord cos I'm so blessed

I'm not the worlds most prettiest but I turned out fine
I thank the lord cos I'm truly blessed, I'm a star that always shines
You can mark the word, you may not know it yet but my name will live on when I resign
Cos I'm fine, yeah I'm so fine
I'm a beautiful woman, a intriguing woman, a strong, strong woman

Love yourself no matter where you from, black, white, brown, it doesn't matter
God has created us in his own image and you need to love what god has created
Low self esteem? You don't need that! Trust me, you're all good in his sight you're beautiful, alright?
So smile and say after me

I'm not the worlds most prettiest but I turned out fine
I thank the lord cos I'm truly blessed, I'm a star that always shines
You can mark the word, you may not know it yet but my name will live on when I resign
Cos I'm fine, yeah I'm so fine

Give yourself a round of applause, you're beautiful inside and out

I'm not the worlds most prettiest but I turned out fine
I thank the lord cos I'm truly blessed, I'm a star that always shines
You can mark the word, you may not know it yet but my name will live on when I resign
Cos I'm fine, yeah I'm so fine
I'm beautiful, I love myself and that makes me such a happy woman
Mwah, love yourself!
