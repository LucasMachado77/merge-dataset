Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that the man
Has got to deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
Cause it's all about the dark in me
Mm-hmm

I wanna freak in the morning
A freak in the evening, just like me
I need a roughneck brother
That can satisfy me, just for me
If you are that kind of man, 'cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

'Cause I will be a freak, until the day until the dawn
And we can pump, pump all through the night till the early morn'
Come on and I will take you around the 'hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can pump, pump
Any time of day it's all good for me

Boy, you're moving kind of slow
You got to keep it up now, there you go
There's just one thing that a man must do
I'm packing all the flavours you need
I got you shook up on your knees
'Cause it's all about the dog in me

I wanna freak in the morning
A freak in the evening just like me
I need a roughneck brother
That can satisfy me, just for me
If you are that kind of man, cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

Cause I will be a freak until the day until the dawn (Freak in me)
And we can pump, pump all through the night till the early morn (You'll bring out the freak, yeah, yeah)
Come on and I will take you around the 'hood on a gangsta lean (Taking you around the hood)
Cause we can pump, pump
Any time of day it's all good for me
(It's all good for me!)

(Good for me!)
I wanna freak in the morning
A freak in the evening, just like me
I need a roughneck brother
That can satisfy me, just for me
