All along the railway track
From LA to Hackensack and back
Every single heart beats clickety-clack
(That Jane from Maine)

Engineers all wave and sigh
When they see her gaily passing by
Everyone keeps dreamin' he's the guy
(To kiss that Jane from Maine)

Diners in the diner
All declare there's no one finer
From the state of Carolina up to Maine
Hear the fellas holler
Gettting hot under the collar
"Hey Mister Porter!"
("Bring some ice water!")
Locomotives fast as sound
Make a whistle stop when she's around
(For her smile will gain a mile of ground)
As they travel on their way
The clickety-clack of the railway track
Will clickety-clack and bring 'em back
To Jane
That Jane from Maine

Diners in the diner

Make a whistle stop when she's around
(For her smile will gain a mile of ground)
As they travel on their way
The clickety-clack of the railway track
Will clickety-clack and bring 'em back
To Jane
That Jane from Maine
