Early mornin'
Alright, I was a little late last night
Got a little messy
Early mornin'
Can't be like that anymore, no

I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'

Met a dark dude, kinda dark hair
When he walked up, Tony grabbed him
But I liked him, told him, "Come here"
Kinda cool
Baby, we can make plans
Where you live? Does your mama live there?
We can hook up at the hotel
He's down so I told him, "Let's go"
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'

Oh, in love
I went out with my girl Jen
And we called up Gabe and his friends
He was talking 'bout hitting up show
So I said, "What the hell, let's go"
Got up, got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
But what happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin' (it don't stop till the early morning)
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin' (it don't stop till the early morning)

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again, let's do it again
Yes, early mornin'
Yes, can't keep doin' this

I'll light your fire, your one desire
Pull on me, baby, and I'll take you higher (I wanna get with you)
You should try her
So come over here and let's go so

I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin' (oh, whoa, oh)
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin' (it don't stop till the early morning)
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning (I'm yawning)
Just walked in and it's early mornin' (oh)
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends (yes)
Let's do it again, let's do it

Early mornin'
Early mornin'
