Oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah

What good is the money
When lately we've been missing each other
'Cause we've got work and kids, you know how it goes
Monday through Friday, 9 to 5
We spend most of the time chasing that dough

But not tonight, we're gonna both get fly
Call your momma, tell her come over
So we can have quality time
'Cause it's been too long since I held you in my arms
I can't wait no more, I'm ready to, oh...

You make me wanna
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs
Do thangs with you
Can't believe the things I wanna do
Tonight we left home our worries
Put the kids to bed
I'm going out instead with you
Steppin' out with you
I'm steppin on out with you, darling

Girl, put that celly down
Don't even peek at your pager now
Just chill, relax, the kids will be cool
Grab two more Cosmos, we ain't thinkin' about tomorrow
We're in a club full of people
But it feels just like me and you

My baby's looking hot tonight
Catching everybody's eye
Look at them starin', but I ain't carin'
'Cause I know you're mine
We should do this more often
Got a fella feelin' kinda flossy
I can't wait to make your body go ooh, ooh, ooh

You make me wanna
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs
Do thangs with you
You and you and you and you and and you only you
Tonight we left home our worries
Put the kids to bed
I'm going out instead with you
Everything's gonna be alright

You make me wanna
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs
Do thangs with you
I wanna do what we never get to do
Tonight we left home our worries
Put the kids to bed
I'm going out instead with you

(You know how it goes)
(Keep chasin' that dough)

I'll ring the bell like I used to do
Hold the door for you, let you through
Take your hand and talk to you
Make you know you're my star
I'm gonna woo ya (yeah yeah)
Say pretty words to ya (yeah yeah)
Send chills right through ya (ooh yeah)
And remind you how loved you are, ooh...

You make me wanna
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs
Do thangs with you
Yes you do, ooh...
Tonight we gon' forget our worries
Put the kids to bed
I'm going out instead with you

You make me wanna
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs
Do thangs with you
You and you and you and you and and you only you
Tonight we left home our worries
Put the kids to bed
I'm going out instead with you
Everything's gonna be alright now, baby

You make me wanna
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs
Do thangs with you
I wanna do what we never get to do
Tonight we left home our worries
Put the kids to bed
I'm going out instead with you
Ooh ooh yeah

Do thangs, do thangs
Do thangs, do thangs
