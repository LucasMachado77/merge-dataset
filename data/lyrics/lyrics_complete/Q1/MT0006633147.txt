There were beggars and kings in a magical sky
There were wings in the air
And I learned how to fly
There was me
There was you in a world made for two
Then you were gone

Moonlight lady
Come along with me
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me

Moonlight lady
Come along with me
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me
She wore satin and lace on the beach
And her beauty was there to inspire
She was loving the night in the grasp
Of a soft lit fire

Moonlight lady
Come along with me
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me

Moonlight lady
Come along with me
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me

Every night is so empty without you
I'm so lonely since you went away
If by chance we could dance to the music
Let it play, let me say

Moonlight lady
(Sexy, sexy lady)
Come along with me
(You just drive me crazy)
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me
Moonlight lady
(Sexy, sexy lady)
Come along with me
(You just drive me crazy)
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me

Seems it never rains in Southern California
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me
It never rains in California
But, girl, don't they warn ya
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me

Seems it never rains in Southern California
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me
It never rains in California
But, girl, don't they warn ya
To the bright city lights
It's all right cause tonight's on me
