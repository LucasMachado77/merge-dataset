I never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never
Knew I was lost, baby

Oh, until I met you
Now it's joy and happiness, girl yes
Feels like I've been blessed, girl
Lord, have mercy now

(Well, well, well) Lay back
Just relax, baby
I don't want you to move
(Don't Move)
If there's something that you want
Tell me, baby
I'll run out and get it for you
(I'll do that baby)
You deserve to be treated, yeah
In the best of ways
I'm going to treat you
Like a queen baby
I want to do that for you
Each and every, every, every, day

Ah no one does it better
Does it better than you, girl
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I want to spend all of my time
Just loving you
Loving you

Oh, oh, oh
Baby, I'm totally lost
Lost in your love
Don't want to be found, baby
Like the way you
Move you love around
Lost in your love

Something else

In your arms, I'm a new man
I'm a new man
No one loves me
Like you can. no
So sweet in the things you do
I swear there's nothing
Like loving you

Let's make it last forever, ever
Forever, and a day, oh
Promise me we'll stay together
Well, well, well

Are we going to
Keep it this way, yeah
Ah, no one does it better
(Does it better), does it better
Better than you do, no
And I just want to keep right on
Loving you, Loving you
And, oh, oh
I'm totally, babe
Lost in your love
I don't want to be found
(stay up in here, right here)
Lost in your love

Never knew, never knew, never knew
Never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never knew baby

Lost in your love
Your love could be so good, girl
Keep on pushing me
Lost in your love
I don't want to
Don't want to be found

Lost in your love
I like the way you
Move me around and around
And around, and around....
Lost in your love

Touch me here, touch me here
Touch me there, touch me there
You've been touching stuff
I never, never knew
Was there, baby
Nobody does it better
(Bring it out of me, baby)
Well, well, well
Lost in your love
Nobody does it better
No one can compare, baby
Lost in your love
And I want to love you
For the rest of my days
The rest of my days, yea baby
Lost in your love
Nobody does it better
Nobody does the things you do
(Forever, ever, and ever, and ever)
Lost in your love

Nobody does it better
And better, and better
And better it's getting better
Lost in your love
You got me wrapped up
Wrapped up, wrapped up loving you
Lost in your love

I know, I know, I know, I know
Lost in your love
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Lost in your love
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Na, na, na, na
Lost in your love
