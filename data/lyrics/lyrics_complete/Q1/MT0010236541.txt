Uptown, another endless night
Hearts break in early morning light
(Yeah) I take my time
Downtown, a lonesome boy at home
Don't know what's really going on
(Yeah) I take my time
But underneath it all, I know it feels so right (It feels so right)
I feel I'm going crazy, but I won't cry tonight

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know
I never meant to break a promise (Whoa)
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't turn away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you

If I could start it all again
I'd know you're more than just a friend
(Yeah) I turn back time (Turn back time)
But underneath it all, I know it feels so right (It feels so right)
I feel I'm going crazy, but I won't cry tonight

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know
I never meant to break a promise (Whoa)
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't turn away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you

Come take my hand, let's break away (Away)
Don't stop, don't be afraid
'Cause I know (I know)
We'll be forever

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
I never meant to break a promise (Whoa)
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't turn away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
You're the one who leaves me breathless
