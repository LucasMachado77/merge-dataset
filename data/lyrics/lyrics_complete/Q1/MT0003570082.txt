Every night mi go to sleep mi have wet dreams
Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down

You in your small corner, I stand in mine
Throw all the punch you want to, I can take them all

Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down

Look how you're big and fat, like a big, big shot
Give the crumpet to big foot joe, give the fanny to me

Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Huh, Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Huh, lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
So he said, lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
Huh, lie down gal let me push it up push it up lie down
