Ooh
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time each year
Ooh ooh

Well, way up North where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled, we call it ol' Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's ol' candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick little Saint Nick

Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer ah
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer we don't miss no one
He's hauling through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with a-Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Ah ooh
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time each year
Ah ooh
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time each year!
