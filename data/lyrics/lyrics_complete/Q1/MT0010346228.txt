Jumpin' out the window
Movin' on, groovin' on
Which way will the wind blow?
We can't be wrong, so say "So long"
I'ma pick you up, I'ma pick you up
What you tryna say to me?
Catch the train at two, what you tryna do?
Are you gonna play with me?

All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip, I'ma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?

Breaking through the boundaries
Rollin' on, strollin' on
They won't ever find me
After all, we'll have a ball
I'ma pick you up, Im'a pick u up
We're gonna see where we can go
This is how I live, this is what I give
And you're the one I wanna know

All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip, I'ma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?

Tiny minded two-toned suckers
Same old faces make me shudder
Countless times I've screamed "Oh, brother!"
Where are you? I need someone to be my lover!

All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip, I'ma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?

It's a trip, I'ma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?
