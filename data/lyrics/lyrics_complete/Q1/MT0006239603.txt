Watch when they walk by
Guys get the wondering eye
They rather get smacked then not look back
Tell you whats up with that

They see that wobble wobble
Shaped just like a cola bottle
Thought you was a model
Itty bitty waist
Hip-hips all in they face

Thats gonna get them boys in trouble
Get his attention on the double
She got a walk so mean gotta see it to believe
(hey)

She got them
Baby makin hips
Ba baby baby makin hips
She got them baby makin hips
When she walk they watchin and she knows it
She got them baby makin hips
Ba baby baby makin hips
Watch her watch her work them curves
Dont be mad you got some nerves

Strut without a care
Gloss them lips slick back that hair
That suit fits you like a mitten
Got them wishing picturing you with them
Caught em watching

Wrapped around your french manicure finger tips
That boy like em thick
