When I'm down and out
She stays by me without a doubt
And if I stumble like I'm going to fall
She's right there at my beck and call

She's my wonder woman, wonder one
What she can't do, can't be done
(Make me feel so good)
Early in the morning
(I feel so good and fine)

A friend a mine said with this girl I shouldn't stay
But hey guess what?
I stuck by her anyway
O Lord, yeah yeah, I'm glad I did
Just look what I'd be missing if I'd listened to that young kid

Well every now and then, yeah yeah
I thank my maker for the shape I'm in
(Make me feel so good)
Early in the morning
(I feel so good and fine)

She makes me feel ten feet tall
If I'm worth anything she's got it all
Weeks into months
Months into years
I got to tell you how sweet it is

If you ever leave my life
I would surely die, cry and cry
(Make me feel so good)
Makes me wanna, makes me want to feel
(I feel so good and fine)

Sometimes I think something will go wrong
Nothing this good ever lasts long
Then you come along and guarantee
Just how much you mean to me

Well every now and then, yeah yeah
I thank my maker for the shape I'm in
(Make me feel so good)
Early in the morning
(I feel so good and fine)
Oooooh
Yeah-ah-ah
