Saw her in a red skirt, from a distance
Pull the Rover over, I couldn't resist this
(Queen girl) So round and fine
I know sixteen gets me twenty
At least two years before I get mine
Well, it's because she's only 16
Whew! And though (Although she's fine)
She's truly untouchable cause
She's only 16 (I guess we gotta wait!)

She's lovely... lovely
(Sixteen'll get you twenty, so call me when you get this many)
She's lovely... lovely

Couldn't help but think, if only she was older
Would it be worth my time, if I tried to mold her?
Question - word to your pops
Would he understand my intentions? (Or would he call the cops?)

She got a fly jiggy style so I'm hawkin you
Can I talk to you? Talk to you?
Or can I take a little walk in Boston with you?
I got the rum, mmm.. and then some
I got the keys to my Benz, believe your friends
We can start something new, like lovely trends
Tell your mom and your dad I said hey
Call you on your eighteenth birthday

She's lovely... lovely
(Sixteen'll get you twenty, so call me when you get this many)
She's lovely... lovely

She's lovely... lovely
(Sixteen'll get you twenty, so call me when you get this many)
She's lovely... lovely

Style, style, soft and tender
Young but I'm sprung on the fact that she's the winner
Ooh, so sweet, can I taste?
Nah, I think I better wait
for the 1-8, or the 1-9
Call her every now and then because she's only six plus ten
Lovely, tempting, y'know?
Hmm, I think I better ghost ("No")

I'm saying cause she's only sixteen...
And even though, she's so lovely but untouchable
Cause she's only 16 ("Three sixty degrees")

She's lovely... lovely
(Sixteen'll get you twenty, so call me when you get this many)
She's lovely... lovely
