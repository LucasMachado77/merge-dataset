I know a tropical island
Where the mango moon and banana sun shine

Kermit the Frog:
And on this tropical island
There lives a cousin of mine

He's a Caribbean amphibian
He likes to hop in the tropical sea
Carribean amphibian
A frog in a coconut tree

He's a Caribbean amphibian
He likes to hop in the tropical sea
Carribean amphibian
A frog in a coconut tree

Kermit the Frog:
The flying fish and the turtles
They've seen him hop where the pineapple grows
He likes to see all the islands
So island-hopping he goes

Sometimes he hops to Jamaica
Sometimes to Haiti he hops
Sometimes the warm Puerto Rican beach
Is where he finally stops
He's a Caribbean amphibian
He likes to hop in the tropical sea
Carribean amphibian
A frog in a coconut tree
A frog in a coconut tree

Sometimes he lives in the water
Sometimes he lives on the land
Sometimes he likes to play music in
An all-amphibian band

Everybody!

He's a Caribbean amphibian
He likes to hop in the tropical sea
Carribean amphibian
A frog in a coconut tree
A frog in a coconut tree
He's a frog in a coconut tree

Ribbit! Ribbit!
