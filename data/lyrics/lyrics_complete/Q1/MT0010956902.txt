When you're feeling down and out
Wondering what this world's about
I know a place that has the answer.

It's a place where no one dies.
It's a land where no one cries.
And good vibrations always
Greet you.

How I love when my thoughts run
To the land of make believe.
Where everything is fun
Forever.

Children always gather around
Mother Goose and all her rhyme
They fill the air with sounds
Of laughter.

People dancing
Their hearts are filled
With all the reasons why.
You and I should learn the way
Of the land of make believe
And make this world of ours
Much brighter.

I once asked the Wizard of Oz
For the secret of his land
He said, "Just take a look around here.
Seven dwarves and Little Boy Blue,
Uncle Remus and Snow White, too.
(Now, just between us,
That's what's known as integration.)

Jack and Jill are hard at work
Helping children dream awhile,
And Snoopys making smiles
For grown-ups.

All the elves are making toys
They are rich with all the joys
Of seeing happy kids
At Christmas.

We are waiting
To help you find
The dream made just for you.

In a few words let's just say
That in answer to your quiz
Imagination is
The secret."

Hear the music of the band
It was written in our land
For what's a song but someone's
Dream?

In your world there was a King
He once said, "I have a dream,"
Now there's a man who new
The secret.

Dreams are really
The thoughts that you
Have hidden in your heart.

When you start a brand new day
Let your heart show you the way
And make a dream or two
Come true.

How I love when my thoughts run
To the land of make believe
Where everything is fun
Forever.
