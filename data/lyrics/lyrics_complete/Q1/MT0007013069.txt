I'll grab the sun and the moon
I'll hold the world in my hand
These things are easy for me
I can't make you understand

Pulling rabbits out of a hat
Pulling rabbits out of a hat
All I get is polite applause
Applause, applause, applause
Applause, applause

Marvel at heaven and hell
(Marvel at heaven and hell)
Gasp at the Champs-Elysees
(Gasp at the Champs-Elysees)

Raise the Titanic and then
(Raise the Titanic and then)
I see you turning away

Pulling rabbits out of a hat
Pulling rabbits out of a hat
All I get is polite applause
Applause, applause, applause
Applause, applause
Entertaining that's the word I get from you
Entertaining and then you bid a fond adieu, well, adieu

I'll make a pauper a King
(I'll make a pauper a King)
I'll turn your water to wine
(I'll turn your water to wine)

These things are easy for me
(These things are easy for me)
How come I can't change your mind?

Pulling rabbits out of a hat
(Pulling rabbits out of a hat)
Pulling rabbits out of a hat
(Pulling rabbits out of a hat)

All I get is polite applause
(All I get is polite applause)
Applause, applause, applause
Applause, applause

Applause, applause, applause
Applause, applause
Applause, applause, applause
Applause, applause
