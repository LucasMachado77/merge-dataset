Please don't stop your love
Please don't stop your love
Please don't stop your love
(Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love)
(Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love)

Every time I'm around
You make me feel like a lady, amazing
They could take pointers from you
If they paid attention to the way you move
Elegantly, handling gently
Never getting my love mistaken
Knowing what you want from me, exactly
I know what I want from you, baby, please

Please don't stop
Lovin' me the way you do (Lovin' me the way you do)
All I want is your smile around
Boy, you bring so much joy, baby, yeah

No one has been more into it, the way he feels
And that's what turns me on, lovin' the way you do
(With the fact that you have) More than one string attached
It takes a real man to understand no one should come
In between what means more to you
To me, you're a perfect example of what a man should be
If only I could get a piece, I'd make you so happy, baby

Please don't stop
Lovin' me the way you do (Lovin' me the way you do)
All I want is your smile around
Boy, you bring so much joy, so
Please don't stop
Lovin' me the way you do (I blush when you're near me)
All I want is your smile around (All I want is your smile)
Boy, you bring so much joy, baby, yeah

Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love (Please don't stop your love)
Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love
(Please don't stop your love)
Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love
(Please don't stop your love)
Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love

Please don't stop
Lovin' me the way you do (Baby, please)
(Lovin' me the way you do)
All I want is your smile around
Boy, you bring so much joy, so
Please don't stop (Please don't)
Lovin' me the way you do (Lovin' me the way you do)
All I want is your smile around (Baby)
Boy, you bring so much joy, break it down

Please don't stop (Lovin' me)
Lovin' me the way you do (Said all I want)
All I want is your smile around (Baby)
Boy, you bring so much joy (You bring me so much joy)
Please don't stop
Lovin' me the way you do (Lovin' me the way you do)
All I want is your smile around (Baby)
Boy you bring so much joy (Baby, yeah)
You bring me so much joy (Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy)

Please don't stop your love
Please don't stop your love
Please don't stop your love
(Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love)
Please don't stop your love
(Please don't stop it, baby, don't stop it, baby, don't stop your love)
Please don't stop your love
