Roll 'em in the morning
Roll without no warning
Hot damn, hot damn, hot damn
You know that he could
And he would, yeah
He's a high rollin' man
In a high rollin' neighborhood

Sing it
Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em
Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em
Don't do much good
But good Lord, he could roll 'em

Lord, he was a dreamer
Hardly worth redeeming
Hot damn, hot damn, hot damn
You know that he was
Lord, he was

But when it comes to his thumbs
Ain't a man who can do what he does

Hear it
Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em,
Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em
Don't do much good,
But good Lord, he could roll 'em

Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em,
Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em
Don't do much good,
But good Lord, he could roll 'em

Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em,
Roll 'em, roll 'em,
C'mon roll 'em
Don't do much good,
But good Lord, he could roll 'em
