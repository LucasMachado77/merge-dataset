I wouldn't change a single thing about you baby
You shower my world with your love
You got a way about ya baby
That lets me know that there's no other man

You take care of home
I was lost until I found you
Refuse to live without you
As long as you are good to me

I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally

I used to think I knew love before I met ya
You love my defenses down baby
I let you into my heart
And you unlocked true love in me

You take care of home
I was lost until I found you
Refuse to live without you
As long as you are good to me

I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally

So hard to find true love baby
Don't wanna live without you
I know this love is forever
Cause it shows in every little thing you do
Always make a way to see love through
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally

I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally
I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally
