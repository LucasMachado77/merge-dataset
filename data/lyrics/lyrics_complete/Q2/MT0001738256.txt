Gettin'sick of everyone around here
I don't think you know or understand
All these people think they fuckin'know me
Circulate the rumors again

Think you want something
Don't you know the price you pay
Don't you know nothing's ever gonna go your way

Gettin'sick of everybody's breakdown
I don't think they know or understand
All these fucking people try to play me
Now I've got to beat them at their games
