Sig sauer
Victim of a systems non-control
Devour
Striking terror into every soul

Communication breakdown onto self destruction
Schizophrenic people breeding hate
Pessimistic thinking from a failed connection
Survival comes when we annihilate

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun

Paranoia
Termination sickness zeros good
Blind power
Executing humans in cold blood

Degenerating children with an opiate bullet
Poison flows from words out on the street
Trapped inside the home that has become the prison
Dissin' everybody that we meet

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Ah, ah, ah
Ah

Gun
Gun
Gun
Gun

Locked and loaded
Governmental loss to anarchy
Weapon goaded
Magnum is gagging liberty

Cultural collision in an endless frenzy
Numbing minds with threats of violence
Hopeless to the dream of any decent future
Running on sheer fear and ignorance

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun, yeah, yeah
