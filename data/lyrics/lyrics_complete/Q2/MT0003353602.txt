I can't breathe, I can't think
What's going one? I've gotta get away
Can't breathe, can't think
What's going on?, it suffocates
Take the pain
I search and find, because you're on my mind
All my feeling denied, (feel like) I want to die
State of mind
Don't know where I'm going on
But I've go to get away
State of mind
