You should have listened to your mother
And ate your veggies when you were younger
You should have listened to your parents
And doubled up on your peas and carrots

Even though I eat meat
I appreciate the irony
Now that the cows are going mad
The vegetarians are laughing at us now

Well this just makes you want to hate them even more
But if you indulge in that
You're no smarter than the slab of beef you eat
The one that's now driving you mad

I hate to be an "I told you so"
But I fucking told you so
Meat is murder and it's killing you
Now what the hell are you going to do?
