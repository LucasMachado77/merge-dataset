Fallen victim, feel the weight of the world
Crush the thought of what could have been
Will it end here? Have you given enough?
Did you reach your death bed alive?
Falling further than ever, no more
From victim to killer, forgive you for failing the mentor
Taking over what little is left of you

Your battle called self destruction isn't what it used to be
No hope for the disillusioned, so forget what you see
There's not enough here to go around
So unfortunately, you're the one with the shortest straw
And I guess that you is me
Stand and defend
Save the little that's left
Never let the past show, no regret, break the broken
Given all the remains and take heed from the silence spoken
No room for failure, depends on a lifeless center
Living for a shadow of closure
Leaving nothing but the chaos because of you

Your battle called self destruction isn't what it used to be
No hope for the disillusioned, so forget what you see
There's not enough here to go around
So unfortunately, you're the one with the shortest straw
And I guess that you is me

(No hope for the disillusioned)
And you is me
(No hope for the disillusioned)
And you is me
(No hope for the disillusioned)
And you is me
(No hope for the disillusioned)
And you is me

Your battle called self destruction isn't what it used to be
No hope for the disillusioned, so forget what you see
There's not enough here to go around
So unfortunately, you're the one with the shortest straw
And I guess that you is me
That you is me
That you is me
That you is me
That you is me
