Livin inside enclosed walls
Got no money in my pockets
No pictures on the walls
Wake up with a gun on my head
That's the life, the life i've lead

What can i do?

Life's hard so
I gotta be hard too

But things always seem to get in my way
But i'm gonna get over for another day

Survival of the streets!
Survival of the streets!
Survival of the streets!
Livin in burnt out buildings
Livin in the streets
It's the life of the cro-mags
Survival of the streets
Never know what's comin up ahead
If the beast pulls the trigger could wind up dead
