Right now like a step outside
My heart beats genocide
Tearing out all the crippled walls
Drawing fire from the mortal flaws

To take it in on the chin, don't want to face it
We generate our debate to try to place it
Fear the eyes of the blind and the fallen
We cauterize as the dream comes crashing down

And like a poison will coerce you
To the very brink of salient pathologies
Your own disease
And with the whole wide world against you
Is it any wonder that it brings you to your knees?
Make war on the fractured climes
Where the infirmed all run on time
I've cried for much less than you
And taken all your pain

Just like a lie you want to throw in the fire
That's how it feels to be exposed as a liar
You fall in line when there's nothing real
It takes hold of everything you feel

Your fear surrounds my soul
Your fear creates my light
Your words are not my life
No time to get it right
Your words are not my life
No time, gotta live but there's no

Time will take me down, it breaks me
Drowning in civility and losses justified
Words like tokens, eyes wide open
Staring down the epitaphs of virtue long denied
