Guns and knives and bombs and gas and bad t.v
This is creation?
Cut down the trees and build another factory
Makes sense to me, man
Why don't you walk right in and let me close the door

What is the thrill in recreating history?
Guns and knives and bombs and gas and bad t.v.,
Yeah why don't you walk right in and let me close the door

More women than ever are investing in this death trap
That's liberation?
Guns and knives and bombs and gas and bad t.v.,
Yeah why don't you walk right in and let me close the door
