Shake this crate, crate of hate
This is what I, what I wake
This is what I, what I wake to each day
Concentrate on every mistake that you make
And mostly that you make

I said, why?
Why?
Why?

You have to shake
Shake
Sh-sh-shake crate of hate
This is what I, what I wait

Call the kettle, kettle black
This is what I got from Jack
Jack, who built his house of sap
And mudslides

I said, why?
Why?
Why?

You have to shake
Quake
Shake, shake crate of hate
This is what I, what I hate
