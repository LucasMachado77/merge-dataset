I'm the ministry of death
Ahoorah!
I'm a marine - I'm hard - I'm trained
I'm part of a brotherhood - no hackers allowed
You scumbag sonofabitch
You bubble-butted bulging maggot piece of shit
You syphilitic Siberian sonofabitch
I'm gonna screw your head off
I'm gonna stick my dick in your nose
I'm gonna sell you to queers
I'm gonna bury you like dog shit
Ahoorah!

Humpin' my rifle like I hump your wife
Ahoorah!
Boots on the ground and head held high
I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die
Ahoorah!

Trained by the corps to be a killing machine

Pin a medal on my chest and give me benefit pay
Pain!
