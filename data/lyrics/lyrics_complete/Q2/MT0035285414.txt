On the might of kings and captains
On the eyes of midnight watchmen
I know my hatred is perfect
For the culprit who deserves it

Dead meat against your broken bones
Thrown in a ditch to die alone
But there is no dream worth pursuing
When there is nobody embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
When there is no blood worth spilling

On the might of kings and captains
On the eyes of midnight watchmen
I know my hatred is perfect
For the culprit who deserves it
Dead meat against your broken bones
Thrown in a ditch to die alone
But there is no dream worth pursuing
When there is nobody embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
When there is no blood worth spilling

I know my hatred is pure for the new recruit
(one, two, three, go!)
Imposters on the fast track
To public execution
Beggars for mercy unite
But your pleas are ineffective
And if you ever come back
Beautiful incarnation
I'll lie down at your feet and
Accept my punishment
You better save yourself
You better save yourself
You better save yourself

But there is no dream worth pursuing
When there is nobody embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
When there is no blood worth spilling
There is no dream worth pursuing
When there is nobody embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
When there is no blood worth spilling
