Ever get the feeling ideals can't take us where we need to go?
Sometimes I'd like to just maybe squash your head, but next time that i see you
I'll probably just smile and say hello
Next time that star shoots across the sky I'm gonna grab it and smash it under my feet

Who wants to be happy?
I'll sleep on the floor and I'll just lock my door
So Dave don't come and tell me "turn down that shit you play"
I wonder what it would be like to be real deep and dark
Typical and boring yea that's me
If I made up the rules you would be not so close to me
