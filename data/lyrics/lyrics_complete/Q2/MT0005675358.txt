I keep saying
I don't understand
Well she knows me
I don't go that way
It might be better
In another town
When you're never there and
He's never around
If you'd ask me
Well it's just not right
And I'll know that
Until the day that I die
And I listen
To every word you say
It might be your truth but
To me It don't make no sence at all

I don't like this
Mess I'm in
My life's been made out of trouble
Since I don't know when
Well it's been some time now
And i've been on my own
I've had time to think now
And it don't make no sence at all

Well that's just my luck

Anyday now
It'll all break down

I keep saying I don't understand
Well she knows I don't go that way

Anyday now
It'll all break down
Yes anyday now
It'll break me
Well c'mon now
Think about it
Take a long hard look at it
You see it don't make no sence at all
