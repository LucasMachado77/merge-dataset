Nothing left in space, the air full of dust
Colored violent haze, colored blood smeared face
Ran away dark dank stank moss, creeps across the river
Run from the dark, dark stark fear, run from the night
Not no night, like tonight
Lust in the walls fall, break away the brick
Tape it to the door, tape it to my fist
Says so sad, dead and mad, angry she dies, tears fall not.
Pain my face, torch my mouth, stained forever, saint for never
Flesh on all my floors, self indulgent gore, nothing left to talk
Nothing left at all
