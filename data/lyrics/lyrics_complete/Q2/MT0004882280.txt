I'm walking down a darkened street
Ignoring everyone I meet
Won't speak to them, they can't see me
In isolated apathy

We've got two cars and four T.V.s
My whole life is planned out for me
I'll get a job and get a wife
In the wasteland I'll spend my life

I'm living in a suburban wasteland
Sterile walls close in on me
Pre-fab junkyard, suburban wasteland
I can't get out, I can't get free

We've got two cars and four T.V.s
My whole life is planned out for me
I'll get a job and get a wife
In the wasteland I'll spend my life

I'm living in a suburban wasteland
Sterile walls close in on me
Pre-fab junkyard, suburban wasteland
I can't get out, I can't get free

I'll see my shrink three times a week
And lean on him, so I stay weak
And if I find I still can't cope
I'll tranquilize myself with dope

I'm walking down a darkened street
Ignoring everyone I meet
Won't speak to them, they can't see me
In isolated apathy
