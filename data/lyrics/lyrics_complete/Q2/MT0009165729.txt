It happened so fast
He didn't have time to think
Or maybe he had too much
A bit too much to drink

When he went riding off
Into the bright sunshine
It turned out to be
The lights of a car

Can somebody help me please?
Scrape this man up off the road
Can somebody help me please?
I cannot do it on my own

As the police
Were scarping him off the fender
A friend of his said
That he had been on a bender

And that he had a huge fight
Yeah, he had a fight with his wife
Then he got pissed off
Then rode off on his bike

He was drunk
He was drunk on a bike
