Wake up!
They try to steal the man in your head
Make you kneel in front of icons
They took the place which wasn't theirs
Enslave you with a power they don't have
Don't need to be guided
Their lambs become rams
Tell them the universe hides inside us all

Ein volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer...

Is it what you got
Or is it what they made
Holy war for holy fools
Blessed are those who break the rules

Men drink the scum of rage
At the lips of warrior priests
What happened, happened again
As no one gets you cannot win
If someone lost

Streams of blood drown soldiers' hate
But mothers' tears call sons' revenge
Stay away from the sectarian and gregarious
If you want to keep the precious gift we share
Be right to yourself, be your own judge
And know, non-resolved things
Generate themselves over and over...
