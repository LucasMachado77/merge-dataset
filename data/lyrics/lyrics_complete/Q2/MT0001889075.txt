Check this out, we've come to the last and final record
This is Dr. Dre in full effect, and we gonna kick it off a little something like this
We got my mella Yella boy on the drums
We got Stan "the Guitar Man" dropping the rhythm
We got LA Dre on the keyboards
And I want the whole posse in this muthafucka to rock on this funky ass beat we finna drop, aight
So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this muthafucka, run it!

Picture a nigga that's raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what's saw
Motherfuckers I slaughter, blow 'em out the water
Word to me, fuck the father
My medley is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can't throw me, I guess you'll blow up
Ever see a sucker scattered? It'd make you throw up
Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tear shit up like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast, I'm solid as Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sit in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, your body twitch, your eyes explode out your skull
'Cause being dull on a flow is a N-O
Niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take ten spaces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on The Grand Finale

Yeah, yeah that was funky
But now we need the muthafuckin' Ruthless Villain to speak
So kick it

The Grand Finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak muthafuckas turn to dust
If you're weak, it ain't your fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turned into a pillar of salt
And niggas that bite me just to taste me
I make the punk muthafuckas buckle up for safety
And those that don't, they caught from the flash
And scream like a bitch when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange their muthafuckin' face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say you're not scared, yo, I can tell 'cause you're shivering
