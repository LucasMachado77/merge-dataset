Immediate gratification of desires
The meaning of life
This propagator of a
Consumeristic lifestyle
So seemingly benign

This is your entitlement
Living an affluent life
A scrap conduction
A shallow state of mind

The delusion of their raison d'etre
Being nothing more than the
Accumulation of mere things
Driven into the consciousness
Of precious young minds
An instrument for turning of the brain
An instrument for death
Compellingly perverted to create
A reality for hiding truth
Creating a window for
Spiritual blessings on sale

No arduous sacrifice or demands
No restraint of passion
No spiritual disciplines, No God!

This is your religion
Feeling without intellectual content
This is your religion
Nihilism 2002!
