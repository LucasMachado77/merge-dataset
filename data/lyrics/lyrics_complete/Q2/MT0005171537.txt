I pledge obedience to the brag
Of the united states of amoebica
And to the repugnance for which it stands
One nation under goth, in denial

With obesity and prejudice for all
Timid fucks gone way off the edge
Anachronistics - thin end of the wedge
Flashing values out of keep with today

Dangerous fanatics hunting enemies to slay
Hypocrites far beyond consistence
Take it from someone observing at a safe distance
Franchise burka king to al-queda for profit

Still, you're offended by a prime time black tit
You're with us or against us
Tell you what, mr. wuss
And make no mistake about my claim

I'm amazed by your wit
But I ain't buying shit
I won't be part of your game
One nation under god

One nation overboard
Christian coalition - obedience
Nra - ignorance
Pmrc - now censor this

You phobic puritans - all shit to me
