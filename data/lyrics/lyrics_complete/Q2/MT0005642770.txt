Took my fucking heart
And you broke your fucking promise
Never trust these hoes
Real nigga always keep it fucking honest
I'm modest
They only mad cause I'm still the hottest
These bitches and these niggas out her living fucking lawless
Write this sonnet then I vomit
False prophets making profits
Goddess but dishonest
Feed your mind
And rejuvenate your soul
Born sinner bumping rich niggas Cole
Say what's on your mind
And speak through your soul
These little niggas steady troll chasing gold
Niggas saying that I'm bold
But I swear I'll never fold
Old heads say I'm cold
Legacy I will uphold
For the goats to say I'm cold
Carry heavy load on this lonely road
And let the fakes get exposed
Gotta keep that shit composed
Or your rhymes will get disposed
Every day it's new hellos
Do some shows I suppose
So they can cite these flows
The new school fucking blows
Sound back from time ago
Fuck the trap I had to grow
Niggas down below that's doing blow
Never been a average joe
So it ain't shit to fuck yo hoe
I rather count my dough
Chilling with my homie Pro
Outerspace a UFO
And so they say I got the glow
I'm in college living poor
But fuck that shit got more in store
Niggas in the 4 that's down for war
Young don't say what's on they heart
So this soul I'll fucking pour
Niggas talking hard but I still don't know what for
Guess I just got more in store
*Real Hip Hop Chant*
Yeah yeah yeah man you know what I'm saying. Man I got my boy Joel in here bruh shit
He telling y'all the real shit man you know what I'm saying like yeah aye we keeping it g we keeping it g man real hip hop in this shit man fuck the trap shit fuck everything else

And I'm just living in my truth
And I'm just living proof
That you ain't gotta cop no coupe
I just be speaking to the youth
They just let the youngin loose
Getting slizzered off the goose
Shouts out to the homie moose
They saying jimmer got the juice
Rappers say they gods
But i don't pray to Zeus
Frantic drug abuse
Then they spit lies in the boothe
I'm just head to speak the truth
But they can't hear me though
Watch in awe and they just jock this flow
And false prophets need to stop it
All that weak shit I just top it
Got so much heat they begging me to drop it
Stage dive head first it's a fucking mosh pit
Damn Dossett they say you called it
Nah homie you thought I lost it
I just boss it
All these bars I just thought it
All that shit you just talk it
Send weak bars and when they don't look
I just toss it
Yeah my dream girl she don't want me
Thoughts of my old girl steady haunt me
My first girl new nigga just taunt me
Man this player shit it just fucking cost me
Fuck it bitches niggas mad cause I'm living bossy
Now they salty
Times was getting rocky
Now I'm jolly
I'm blessed I ain't cocky
Who would you be if you looked up to Wayne
And now you just spit pain
And obviously
It's just gonna go to your brain
Because all these other niggas in your city really all the same
I been dodging all this fame
But look how far that we done came
If you can't feel me man that's a shame
And for the top I'm gonna aim
Obstacles I overcame
Now I'm having dreams as these crowds scream my name
Yes this heat is some flames
I been balling like Dame
Steady changing the game
I'm in college with these thoughts I can't get off my brain
So on Waf's Beats let's get lost in the rain
I'm the man it's 10:00 a.m. and this flow is insane
So when you speak on my name
Just say I changed the game
And ain't do it for the fame
The biggest title I'm gonna claim
I bet they hear the crowd scream my fucking name
I bet I fucking change the game but whose to blame
This is my fucking claim to fame
