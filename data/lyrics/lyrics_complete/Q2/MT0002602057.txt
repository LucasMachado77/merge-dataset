I'm a teen idol ain't I cool
I'm a teen idol making loot
Take a picture of my chest
Little girls think I'm the best
I'm a real macho man
If anyone can do it - I sure can
I was a disco dancer and urban cowboy too
Now I whip it how about you? It's fun to be fake
Following trends
Living other peoples lives
Man the party never ends
Some day I'll be a big pop star
Some day I'll write a song
But now I'm just a teen idol
Playing with my dong
I need a new gimmick
Or I'll fade out real soon
Maybe I'll turn faggot
Then make all the boys swoon
If I become a movie star
And make al ot of scenes
Then I can retire
And make my fashion jeans
