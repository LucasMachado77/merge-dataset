What kind of soul that gets to hell?
All hope abandoned please render here
It's the state of the world address c'mon fuckers

Just look at the state we're in people at odds there's nuclear fission
Mad beef with technology shit ain't right not like it used to be
We pollute the air we breathe and the water that we drink
Modern tempers rage and seethe why don't we stop and think?

At the current rate we're sealing our fate
It's much too late for a world based on hate
We've entered the time of quarrel human beings can't co-exist
No more respect for morals our values have been dismissed

It starts in vicious circles and then it filters down
From governments to local gangs' confrontation all around
State of panic we hang by a thread
The earth will be safe when we're all dead
Call me pessimistic an empty glass a new society after the blast

At the current rate we're sealing our fate
It's much too late for a world based on hate
We've entered the time of quarrel human beings can't co-exist
No more respect for morals our values have been dismissed

Fear spawns greed and see what it brings
A world where no one enjoys the small thing's
Happiness comes from these and within
But we will never find it if we're boiling in sin
