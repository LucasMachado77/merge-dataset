I'll keep pulling on the towpath
You keep floating on the river
Yeah, till the day is done
Keep on keeping on the low road
Chesapeake and Ohio
'Cause on the higher ground you will find

Elephant riders
To the northwest bring news from father

Looking like it's always closing
The Salty Dog is always open
Here, I got an I.O.U
Clickity clack clack, clickity clack clack
Baltimore and Ohio
Clickity clack clack, clickity clack clack
Roll on, roll on

On our way to Washington where work is done by men with gavels
I heard a sound that just about removed me from my filly's saddle
Just outside of Antietam, where once there was a mighty battle
I heard the rhythm of the hammers beating the rail lines together

Elephant riders
To the northwest bring news of battle
Don't be eating all the hard tack
Between we two there's half a small sack.
Still, we got miles to go
Giddy up pony, giddy up pony
Camptown Race is five miles long
Giddy up pony, giddy up pony
Ride on, ride on
