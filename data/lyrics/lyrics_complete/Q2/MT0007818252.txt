Fuck everything you ever told me
You were the one I trusted in
I was so blind
Cut out my own eyes for fear, the sight
These broken pieces of a life I tried to hide
I tried to hide

In this is all I find (All I find)
I'm gone, forsaken (I'm gone, forsaken)
Inside a sullen tomb (Sullen tomb)
Retrace this life (Retrace this life)
And slowly you will understand
This reckoning
This reckoning is regaining power (Power)

Living through the catastrophe
A horrid lapse of senses
We feed a mouth that should not eat
We've gone too far replenished on the weak
I can't decide if we have leapt
Or if we are falling
You'll choke on your lies
It's my only promise
Disgraced me but I'll rise
It's time to regain my pride

Rest assure I'll make a place
Cleansed free of torment
Turn away again, this pain
Shall remain forgotten

I wish, I wish that some day you'll be the one
The one to be withered and dying alone
I wish that some day you'll be the one
I wish
