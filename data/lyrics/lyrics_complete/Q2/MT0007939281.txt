I'm inclined to say
We're disabling the immune
I'm inclined to say
I'm inclined to say!

I'm inclined to say
The power is free will
The story of your life
Potential burning still

We're guiding-Tidal waves
Bringing-Torrential rain
With doom comes hope
This upward slope!
I'm inclined to say
We're disabling the immune
When it comes to probing space
Our time is over due
Foresight-Tyrannical reign
Littered with prophecies
With doom comes hope
This upward slope!

Faceless-Is the mirror of the seer
Useless-Is your money and career
Faceless-Is the mirror of the seer
Useless-Is your money and career

I'm inclined to say
We're disabling the immune
When it comes to probing space
Jupiter and all it's moons

Foresight-Tyrannical reign
Littered with prophecies
With doom comes hope
This upward slope!

Faceless-Is the mirror of the seer
Useless-Is your money and career
Faceless-Is the mirror of the seer
Useless-Is your money and career

I have replaced beliefs
Replaced belief with a tangible grief
Force of will to stay alive so real
Tantalizing the 6th sense
Burning still with a different feel
Petrifying the immense
