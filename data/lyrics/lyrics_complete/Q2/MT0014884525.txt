Last night I was so depressed
And I went and got a Bible
And I turned to the Book of Revelations
And if people would just get, read the Bible
And read the Book of Revelations
They would really turn around and straighten up
All we need to do, to get the good book
And read it, put it to everyday life

Sisters, niggers, whities, Jews, crackers
Don't worry, if there's hell below
We're all gonna go
Ah

Sisters
Brothers and the whities
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors

Hurry
People running from their worries
While the judge and the juries
Dictate the law that's partly flawed
Catcalling, love balling, fussing and cussing
Top billing now is killing
For peace no one is willing
Kind of make you get that feeling

Everybody smoke (everybody smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke)
Use the pill and the dope (and the dope, dope, dope, dope)
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool

And Nixon talking about don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)
He say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)
He say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)
He say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)

But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's a hell below
We're all gonna go (gonna go, gonna go, gonna go, go)

Everybody praying
And everybody saying
But when come time to do
Everybody's laying

Just talking about don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry)
They say don't worry

Sisters
Brothers and the whities
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors

Smoke (smoke)
The pill and the dope (and the dope, dope)
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool

And everybody saying don't worry (don't worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry)

But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's a hell below
We're all gonna go (gonna go, go)
Lord, what we're gonna do

Tell me what we gonna do
If everything I say is true
This ain't no way it ought to be
If only all the mass could see

But they keep talking 'bout don't worry
They say don't worry
They say don't worry
They say don't worry
