I'll wait for the answers someone else has given you
I'll wait for days
I failed my heart for way too long
I've fallen apart, but that's over now
Those who disrespected me tread upon broken glass and they will not last
I gave everything I had just to be here
Their words don't mean shit and life's not fair
So wait for days all alone with the false idea of truth
Pray for the empty walls you built 'round your hope
This is my last request to you before it's too late
Cherish the time you've been given to look forward
Go ahead lie to my face, but just for today
I remember everything
I failed my heart for way too long
I've fallen apart, but that's all over now
It's time to set this straight
We won't turn back now
You turned your back on me
Call out for friends you don't have
We won't turn back now
You turned your back on me
