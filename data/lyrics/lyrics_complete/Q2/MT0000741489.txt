Obscurity hides the plateau
Stars darken in their place
Nanna's glowing above
Illuminates the silent scenery

Seven they are Yezidi's call
Aeon of night Eager to Prevail

From the mountains of dawn they cry
The call of the frantic god
From the womb of mother earth they scream
The wage of creation and sin

("The sleeping lord awakes
Tiamat pulls at her chains
The blind phantom rages
Azag Thoth howls
Vibrations at the black ether's edge
As nocturnal fear penetrates the land
Ecstatical celebrations at their zenith
The seven sharpen their claws...")
Winds emerge from the east
Deep, dark water moves
Even the cold it don eclipses
When they adore the dog-faced beast

As they admit the infernal tide
The eye on the throne derides
The old gods and their tribes
In chaos Tiamat laughs pride..
