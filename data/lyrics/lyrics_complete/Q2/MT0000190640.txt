My wrathful eyes
Piercing from the shivering soul-night
Onto the hellion hordes
On a death-march ride
Against the new light

Immortal bearers of immoral sin
We will crack the sky open to let darkness in

In my night-sight
Blistering carnivore
Feed on your hateful eyes
Phantom-storm
Through the demon gate
Redeem your lies
Crawling up for eternal time venturing
I bid you come forth and get on with the killing

Vestal nausea
Flee before my bloodstained hatchet
Vestal sickness
I am the leech against your plague
