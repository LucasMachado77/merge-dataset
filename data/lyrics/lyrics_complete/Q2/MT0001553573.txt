Compromise, it used to be my choice
Always afraid to speak or raise my voice
Adjustment used to be my only way
Thought everything would work out OK

Frustration and well-hidden anger
Anguish and force-fed denial

That's no way to live!

One too many times I turned the other cheek
I used to hate myself for being way too weak
I've reached a point where I must speak my mind
Silence equals death, I leave regrets behind

Frustration and well-hidden anger
Anguish and force-fed denial

That's no way to live!

I will not bow down
It's my turn to win

That's no way to live!
Now it's my turn to win!
