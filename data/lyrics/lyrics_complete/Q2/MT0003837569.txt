Disfigured, bloodless exit
Soul embrace, soul embraced with pain
Burning existence, eternally separated, savior lost, heaven lost
And tortured within, what could have been

Separation, this after life
In death one breath
Could it be this darkness
Is a product of my design

My choice of self over God
I took what's mine
I denied, denied

Father of lies burn with your legion
Suffer inside eternal abyss
God has, terminate my soul, the committed
Well, I want to dwell within your embrace, your embrace

I had a dream of this reality
My decision to live by my means
I took what's mine, never regret, until now
Until now

Separation from the love I took for granted
Separation from what the love revealed to me

Separation
Separation
Separation
Separation
