Reigning through all destruction
We've found our place in torment
A longing, a bond
Deciding factors awaken us all

I see a figure longing to be strong
Their sights are losing their hold upon fake structure
We fight hard and see the only means we have is soon gone
And we decide the choice is clear
Not fear, just hold strong
We won't let down, sound the alarm
Their end is near

Changing back
Before the days of gluttons
A lie, too much to take for us to resign
This war for peace will be lost
Patience, attention is all we need to prevail in this
Kingdom of ignorance I can't see
Why money tortures thee
Our faith in people has seen the end and
We're now stuck in irrelevance
Strain our blood
And form anew to see a day with justice
Justice

This life, we make
Can't build off the forces that decimate
This life, we make
Must tear down the kingdom that makes us hate, us hate
Hate
Hate
