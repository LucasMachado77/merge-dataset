The soldiers stand waiting
To vindicate this war-torn land
The charge sounds, they march in
They're wondering, will they survive?
The dawn comes, and then the light
We take lives, we hear the screams

No tomorrow, evil has its way
No tomorrow, will I live through this day?
No tomorrow, my life's on the line
No tomorrow, there is still time

The valley lies waiting
The enemy is stalking
When night falls, we press out
Advancing 'til early dawn

No tomorrow, evil has its way
No tomorrow, will I live through this day?
No tomorrow, my life's on the line
No tomorrow, there is still time

Intrepid, our leaders
Decisive, the final blow
Destruction, great defeat
Carnage across the land

No tomorrow, evil has its way
No tomorrow, will I live through this day?
No tomorrow, my life's on the line
No tomorrow, there is still time
