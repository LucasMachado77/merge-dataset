Another year has passed and I'm all right
I lick the salt from my wounds and run into the night
Well, it's unknown
Why collusion goes on
It rapes like betrayal
And I am rotting in the squalor of some

Do you remember the rage?
I remember the hate
I remember that it rained for years
And the blood had left a stain
Hey!

You say I got karma to collect
I dig my grave
And I'm here waiting for some kind of check
And if I get one, I'll hold my breath
I rack my spine
It takes a year for you to warrant a test
As the years go by, I won't cry
It's the year you walked into my life
I will despise

We are the revenants, whoa-oh
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen breath

Another year has passed and I'm all right
I lick the salt from my wounds and run into the night
Run into the night
Run into the night
Run into the night
Run into the night
