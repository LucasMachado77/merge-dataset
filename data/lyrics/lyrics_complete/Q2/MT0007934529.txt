The hardware has been moved into place
Watching distantly from neighboring space
Educated mind is worldly wise
Spawning a new culture -worldly why's?

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it
Yes I'll leave it up to you
I'll leave it, leave it

Pattern matching algorithms scanned
Infrared encoded new world plan

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it
Yes I'll leave it up to you
I'll leave it, leave it up to yo!
Unearth the new sun
Unearth the new sun

An educated mind
Is dangerous to them
Spawning a new culture
When potential lies within!

Data-scrambling
Cryptographic-cryptographic schemes
Growing-growing tissue
Tried and tested-multiplying genes

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it
Yes I'll leave it up to you
I'll leave it, leave it up to you!

Worldly why's?
Spawning a new culture-worldly wise!
The bitter end
The rest depends on you
We have the tools!
Territory under rule!
