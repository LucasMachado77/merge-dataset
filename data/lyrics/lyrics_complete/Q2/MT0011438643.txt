Let's go - let's go
Let's go - let's go
They can't fuck with me now
Huh? Fuck with me now
No, they can't fuck with me now
Can't fuck with me now
Let's go

I go by Weezy The Don
Magnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, freezing the arm
And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off
And if you wonder who the fuck are them killers with the money nigga
We be the squad. It's so serious like
It's like ain't nothing but 10 hot shellies
On the block everyday selling rocks and shit
Chopping bricks - give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs
Ain't nothing sweet 'cause I can't keep trust
little nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Better hide the kids nigga parents and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Look up out the window, see the man and his dogs
Hopping out the van with bandannas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras taking pictures of your family when your abdomen's gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, ramming your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playing with Lil Wayne
Come on!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holding a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check you low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Stop playing with me get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for you
Come around your hood for you
You don't know me, I'll kill everyone who should love you
You have them motherfuckers looking all up in the woods for you

Iceberg Shorty dammit, pants is sagging, forty magnum
Coming out the club on Bacardi's, staggering
Tinted-up Ferrari wagon, bragging
Oh, what's happening?
'round the court 'cause some ex just looked at me
Running with them cats that be clapping the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the ave with the crack and a 'matic
Hoping that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker cracking
If a nigga think about jacking, please believe
I be clip-slapping, click-clacking
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as far away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to eat on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Weezy Wee - CMB's in my blood
Eagle Street 17's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelings for none of these womens
Scrilla, Dough, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the day the man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence
Come on! What!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holding a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check you low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now, them can't fuck with me now
Stop playing when you get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for you
Come around your hood for you
You don't know me, I'll kill everyone who should love you
You have them motherfuckers looking all up in the woods for you
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Come on!

It's too dark for yous
I ain't got no love for yous
Let gunshots smoked yous
Who fuck with us?
Weed, liquor done corrupted us
Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts coming out a man
Running out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it
Niggas be kidding - me awake, DOA
Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face
Oh, shit - niggas on that ho shit
Fours spit so quick like that little nigga ain't got no sense
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:
I cause fatalities for any technicality
Wipe off your family randomly - you understand?
It ain't a motherfucking game, and I ain't fucking playing
Come on!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holding a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check you low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playing when you get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for you
Come around your hood for you
You don't know me, I'll kill everyone who should love you
You have them motherfuckers looking all up in the woods for you
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now
Look-

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holding a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check you low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
They can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playing when you get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for you
Come around your hood for you

You have them motherfuckers looking all up in the woods for you

Them can't fuck with me now - no, they can't fuck with me now

Can't fuck with me now - it's not a game, nigga

Wha, wha, uh, uh, nigga!
Wheezy Whee! (Whee! Whee! Whee!)
