Benumb the masses
Detached from the world within
Degeneration
The serpent's shedding skin

Slaughterous ways
Slaughterous ways

Come on

A reptile devoid of soul
I am the serpent's eyes
Suicidal species
We deserve the die

Slaughterous ways in splendor coiled
Buried deep in blood drenched soil

Mankind's desperation
Designs to slaughterous ways
The world of lies, they showed me
Collapsing in my face

Slaughterous ways in splendor coiled
Buried deep in blood drenched soil
