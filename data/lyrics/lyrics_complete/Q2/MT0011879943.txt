The government talks about conscription
Another self-imposed restriction
Their excuse is no conviction
Patriotism: It's all fiction

There ain't no patriots here no more
Who's gonna fight in the third world war?

Everyone knows it just ain't right
Don't we get the chance to live or die?
They give us hardship all our life
And when we refuse they wonder why

Well I won't fight for my country
Cos the government wouldn't fight for me
They can't afford the Dole money
So they'll put the unemployed in the army
