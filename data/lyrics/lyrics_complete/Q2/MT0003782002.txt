The smell of death seasons the air
Tonight's the night to leave my darksome lair
The mortuary is my goal
I have this craving for some rotten hole

Excitement grasps my sickened brain
And violent throbs my testicular vein
I might be one repulsive creep
Doing what I do when everyone's asleep

Caress the sallow skin
And taste the cavernous eyes with my tongue
I like it when they perished young
As an anal type of guy
I know those dead assholes tend to be dry
So I brought a tube of K-Y

I screw her all night long
Impale her anus and cunt with my dong
And suck on her tits all along
Right after I am done
I grab my carving knife for some more fun
For I am just my father's son

I slit her stomach and her bum
Truncate her torso 'til my arms feel numb
My work is done when she is sliced
I leave her disgraced body vandalized
