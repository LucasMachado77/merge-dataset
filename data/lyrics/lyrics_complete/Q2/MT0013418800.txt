Trying to take away your freedom of choice
Speak up, man, you've got your own voice
Do what's right for your life
Fuck that, stand up and fight

Not gonna say not to drink
But if you do, make sure you think
If it's what you really want to do
Don't let your friends pressure you

Straight edge, I have respect for what you think
But still, I don't think you should fuckin' preach
Because that's your way of life
Think people should do what they think is right

Friends wanna go and get fucked up
Don't have the courage to say what's up
Be afraid they'll think you're a pussy
But they'll understand, just try it out and see
If not, then they're friends you don't need
That's your choice, what's it gonna be?
"Come on, man, let's go get fucked up"
Speak out, peer pressure can suck
"Come on, man, let's go and smoke a doob
Another acid tab for me and you
Let's go and drink some more brew"
Peer pressure is killing you
Not gonna say not to drink
But if you do, make sure you think
If it's what you really want to do
Don't let your friends pressure you

Straight edge, I have respect for what you think
But still, I don't think you should fuckin' preach
Because that's your way of life
Think people should do what they think is right

"Come on, man, let's go get fucked up"
Don't have any courage to say what's up
Be afraid they'll think you're a pussy
But they'll understand, just try it out and see
If not, then they're friends you don't need
That's your choice, what's it gonna be?
"Come on, man, let's go get fucked up"
Speak out, peer pressure can really suck
"Come on, man, let's go and smoke a doob
Another acid tab for me and you
Let's go and drink some more brew"
Peer pressure is killing you
