Fucked up land, fucked up lives
Ethnic cleansing, under darkened skies
Lies and more lies, fuel the fire
War advances, smashing everything in its path
The innocent suffer, victims of the hate mob
Cannon fodder, victims of lies
Propaganda train keeps moving, hiding war crimes
They want you dead, they want your head
