Revolution in the street
Burned body torn and beat
They are just victims of authority

NO MORE AUTHORITY
NO MORE AUTHORITY

I have no respect for authority
Why should they push me
All their lust and greed
Proves their insanity

NO MORE AUTHORITY
NO MORE AUTHORITY

NO MORE AUTHORITY
NO MORE AUTHORITY

One day I'll be old
Then I'll have authority
I'll wish I were young
And I will envy

NO MORE AUTHORITY
NO MORE AUTHORITY
