A face like an angel
A face that won't leave me alone
You bust through the line
And you check me
When i'm on the phone

Everybody tries to steer my way
Never listen to a word i say
But you never saw blue
You never saw red
If is stay then i'm gone
And i'll end up dead

I never was lonely
I never had trouble with love
Then you came along
And your ass
Was as white as a dove
Everybody tries to steer my way
Never listen to a word i say
But you never saw at all
It never seemed right
If is stay then i'm gone
End up in black and white

I never was lonely
And never unlucky in love
Then you came along
And your ass
Was as white as a dove
