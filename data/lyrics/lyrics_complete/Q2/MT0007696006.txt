From grace she fell beneath the ashes
They forced her to her knees, cut her open wide
To bleed her body dry of feeling
(The wounds will form no scars)
The wounds that formed her scars, only memories

Tearing at the scars, she's open wide
Screaming till her lungs collapse
Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside

The tears that line her face, the anguish
(The lies she's fed herself)
The taste that haunts her lips, closing loveless eyes
To bleed her body dry
The feeling of breath escaping lips, closing lifeless eyes
Tearing at the scars she's open wide
Screaming till her lungs collapse
Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside
Dies inside...

She dies inside
She dies inside
She dies in...

Tearing at the scars, she's open wide
Screaming till her lungs collapse
Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside

Tearing at the scars and now she's open wide
A broken, bitter heart that's stained in black
Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside

Dies inside...
