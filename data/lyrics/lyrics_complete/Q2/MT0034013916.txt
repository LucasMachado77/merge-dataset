Hong Kong, Tokyo
This fists of fury gonna break your nose
And it's a showdown and it's a throwdown
Bloodbath down in China Town

There is nothing that you can do
When I unleash hell on you
Money back I gaurantee
We're gonna kung fu you... kung fu you!

Don't know karate, I know K-Razy
Big trouble in little China baby
Don't need a Banzi tree or Mr. Miagi
I'm lethal weapon with my hands and feet
