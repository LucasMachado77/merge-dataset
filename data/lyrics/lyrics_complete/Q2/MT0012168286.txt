Fall black shroud, veil of ignorance
It is a new light we desire
Fall gods of man, worn masks
That our new empire may at last rise up

Fight the fear of freedom, you cannot lose
Fragile are the steps, sharp is the rise
Courage! Our time has come
Courage! The time is now

Souls of steel no-one own us
Murderers of oppression
Chosen race
Just choose to be chosen

Father!
Give us today what is needed
Give it all
Father!
Thy will be done on earth
And in the skies
For ours is the kingdom
And the power and the glory forever
