Uh-huh (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
What you thought, nigga? (Uh)
It's my nigga, Ja, yo
Respect that (Uh-huh)
My nigga
Them niggas get outta pocket (Uh, uh, uh)
My niggas need to stop playin' too ('Less we hit 'em)
Know why?
Nigga, we kill 'em all (All my niggas)
Uh-huh (Yo), we don't miss
Top dog, my niggas
We don't miss (Uh, uh, uh)

It must be the way that I spit shit
That make you say, "Damn, this nigga's ridiculous"
The way I hit 'em and move, nigga that can't lose
Inconspicuous, incognito, niggas ain't ready
For the ever so heavy flow, niggas know I spit deadly
Fear me to the day I'm dead on the streets
With holes in me, the ghetto's got love for me
'Cause I'ma lay for 'em if I have to, gradually there after
The only fib be love and disaster
Tears before laughter, but who gon' cry?
My style be so touchin' it could wipe your eye
Bring truth to obvious lies and dead wise guys
And any bitch niggas feel they fuckin with mines
C'mon, let's get it on 'til the break in the dawn
Before long, if you wrong, you'll be dead and gone
And I live on to glorify my name in vain
What you thought, motherfuckers, I was playin'? Baby, I kill 'em all

Lord, I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Respect mine 'til the date of my demise, baby, I kill 'em all
If you're thinkin' it's a game, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Show 'em I ain't playin', I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For operatin' like lames, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em (Uh)

Baby, I kill 'em all, what you wanna do with this, nigga?
Nothin', so shut the fuck up and learn somethin'
See, my team can get a whole town gamin', then be up
We even take your small change, nigga, give it up
You think my way of life's fucked up, right?
'Til you live it and that cash gets to eatin' at your spirit
Fear it, you be a broke nigga, get near it, you'll be the next nigga
Never have to go back, you been there
Cold stares won't make you a a killer around here
Y'all niggas really got some pitiful ideas
I keep tryin to get this world to see
Hustle hard, mind on that money, my motto be
Stack it if you got it for when you get it
Don't talk about it, just be about it, that it
With all odds against, niggas gettin' rich
Figured to earn a dollar makes sense, baby, I kill 'em all

Lord, I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Respect mine 'til the date of my demise, baby, I kill 'em all
If you're thinkin' it's a game, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Show 'em I ain't playin', I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For operatin' like lames, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em, ha, baby, I kill 'em all

Murderous style, comin' fresh out of Queens Isle (Brooklyn)
Recognize how my killer clique's gettin' down
For theirs while takin' yours in the process
Niggas is stressed, leavin' peep holes in your chest
God bless the next that get laid to rest
Frustration and stress make me question death
I wanna shoot all niggas I feel should be shot
On the spot, let 'em rot with lead in their knot
Talk shit, you bitch-ass niggas be lit
Smokin' weed to give you the heart to proceed
With your game plan, you the man, go for your guns
Feel no remorse when I leave your brain and runs, now
Settle down, get your shit tight
Show respect, move right and everything's alright
But if you slip, son, that ass is gone
Top Dog, motherfuckers, recognize, baby, I'ma kill 'em all

Lord, I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
As long as I'm alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Respect mine 'til the date of my demise, baby, I kill 'em all
If you're thinkin' it's a game, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Show 'em I ain't playin', I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For operatin' like lames, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em, ha, yeah, baby, I kill 'em all

Hit 'em, hit 'em (Yeah)
Uh-huh (Yeah), hit 'em, hit 'em
Top Dog (Hit 'em, hit 'em)
Def Jam (Yeah, baby)
Ja Rule, ha, motherfuckers
Recognize the game, niggas, we don't play
Everybody is made, huh
Lay you down
