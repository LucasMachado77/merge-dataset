Young love, young love, young love, everything I need, I got in my young love
A teenage love, young love, young love, girl, a teenage love

Tell me what's the definition of love?
It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but
Every time they fall up in it, they fall out, in and out it again
Tell me how they gonna know about us
Telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know we can do it

'Cause if it's wilding out, we got that, and forgiving, we got that
If it's talking 'bout how we feeling, we got that
If it's hanging out, keeping it real then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but

Since we ain't twenty-one (Oh)
They be tryna say it ain't love (A teenage love)
'Cause we can't hit the clubs
They be tryna say we're too young (A teenage love)
I ain't saying that we're tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love

It's crazy how all our friends say
That we gone, they still tryna figure us out, babe

And we don't gotta front, we ain't gotta pretend, girl
And you know a couple of 'em gon' hate (Yeah)
Talk behind your back (And), smile up in your face
Oh, girl, we can prove 'em wrong and show 'em how it's done
And, girl, I know that we can do it just because

If we're wilding out, we got that, forgiving, we got that
Talking 'bout how we're feeling, we got that
If it's hanging out, keepin' it real, then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but
