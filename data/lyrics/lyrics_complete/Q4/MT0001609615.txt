She gently brushed my arm as she walked by me
Then she turned and said, "I'm sorry" with a smile
She was everything I ever dreamed of meeting
But I quickly closed my eyes and walked the other way

'Cause you can't fall in love when you're cryin'
Please don't try to look into my eyes
If I said I love you I'd be lyin'
'Cause the memory of yesterday is still in my mind

She caught me just before I reached the corner
Then she asked me most politely for my name
She was more than just a girl, she was an angel
And I wanted so to lie but I told her just the same

You see you can't fall in love when you're cryin'
Please don't try to look into my eyes
If I said I love you I'd be lyin'
'Cause the memory of yesterday is still in my mind

She winked and said, "I know just what you're feelin'
And I know there's nothing I can say
That can change the way you feel so here's my number
You can call me on the phone when the feeling goes away"

'Cause I know you can't fall in love when you're cryin'
Please don't try to look into my eyes
If I said I love you I'd be lyin'
'Cause the memory of yesterday is still in my mind
