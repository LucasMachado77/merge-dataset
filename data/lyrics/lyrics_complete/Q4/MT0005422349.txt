Come fly with me we'll fly, we'll fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me we'll fly, we'll fly away

Come fly with me we'll float down to Peru
In llama land there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me we'll float down in the blue

Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide starry eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You might hear angels cheer because we're together

Weather wise it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat those birds
Down to Acapulco bay
Hey, it's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away

Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You might hear a gang of angels cheer because we're together

Weather wise it's such a cool cool day
Just say the words and we'll beat those birds
Down to Acapulco bay
Hey, it's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, pack up, pack up
Let's fly away
