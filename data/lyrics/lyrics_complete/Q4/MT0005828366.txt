Before there was time
There were visions in Your mind
There was death in the fall of mankind
But there was life in salvation's design

Before there were days
There were nights I could not see Your face
But the night couldn't keep me from grace
When You came and You took my place

So I cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
Ancient of days
Cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
And sing the praises
Of the One who saved me
And the promises He made
Before there was time
You counted the hairs on my head
You knew all the words that I've said
You purchased me back from the dead

Before I was made
You searched me and knew my ways
You numbered all of my days
And You set forth the steps I would take

So I cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
Ancient of days
Cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
And sing the praises
Of the One who saved me
And the promises He made

You saved me
You raised me
You saved me
You pulled me from the grave

So I cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
Ancient of days
Cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
And sing the praises

So I cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
Ancient of days
Cry holy only
Begotten Son of God
And sing the praises
Of the One who saved me
And the promises He made
Before there was time
