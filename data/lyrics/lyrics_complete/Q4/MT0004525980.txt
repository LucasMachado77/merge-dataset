Every place that we ever knew
Just a time we held on to
Every space that we ever made
Just a piece of ourselves we saved
Every light that we ever held
Just a fire from a dark, dark spell
Every love that we ever crave
Just a thing to be kept and caged

(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet

Every dream that we ever ride
Just a place for our souls to hide
Every fear that we ever chase
Just the fear of the truth we face

(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet

I've made journeys though light
I've made journeys through dark
And it's the price I've paid
But I knew from the start with each beat of my heart
That you just blow me away

(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes) Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes) Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
