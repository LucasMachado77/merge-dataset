There's a land that I have heard about
So far across the sea
There's a land that I have heard about
So far across the sea

To have you all, my dreamland
Would be like heaven to me
To have you all, my dreamland
Would be like heaven to me

We'll get our breakfast from the tree
We'll get our honey from the bees
We'll take a ride on the waterfalls
And all the glories, we'll have them all

And we'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun
We'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun

Oh, what a time that will be
Oh, just you, wait, wait, wait and see
We'll count the stars up in the sky
And surely we'll never die
And surely we'll never die, oh no
And surely we'll never die
