It's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
And a long, long way to your home
But the change in your pocket is beginning to grumble
And you reap just about what you've sown
You can walk down the street, pass your face in the window
You can keep on fooling around
You can work day and night, take a chance on promotion
You can fall through a hole in the ground

Now there ain't no game like the game you been playing
When you got a little something to lose
And there ain't no time like the time you been wasting
And you waste just about what you choose
There's a man at the table and you know he's been able
To return all the odds that you lay
But you can't feed your hunger and you ain't getting younger
And your tongue ain't got nothing to say

It's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
And a long, long way to your home
But the ground underneath you is beginning to tremble
And the sky up above you has grown
There's a time to be moving and a time to be grooving
And a time just for climbing the wall
But the odds have been doubled, and it ain't worth the trouble
And you're never going nowhere at all
