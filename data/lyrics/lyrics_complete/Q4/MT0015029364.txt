I look at her and I say to myself
There's my lover
Just imagine she comes running to me
For love

I feel so proud I could shout to the crowd
There's my lover
But the crowd mustn't know
For I mustn't show my love

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me
Oh, but the Fates have blessed me

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover
Be it right, be it wrong
I'll always belong to her

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover
Be it right, be it wrong
I'll always belong to her
