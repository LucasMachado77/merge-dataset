I am standing on the Jordan
Gazing 'cross the stormy tide
There I'll rest my every burden
'Til all doubts and fears, doubts and fears subside

Oh yes, I can hear the angels singing
I can see them, Lord, around the throne
Well, I can hear, I hear the saints, child, oh, singing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah now, now 'tis done, yes

Tell me, how far am I from Canaan?
Lord, how far am I from Canaan?
Where well, the angels singing and joy bell ringing and glory
Well, I wanna know how far am I from Canaan

Lord over there we shout troubles over
Lord over there we shout troubles over

Where well, the angels singing and joy bell ringing and glory
Well, I wanna know how far am I from Canaan

Lord up there I'll lead my mother
Lord up there I'll lead my mother

Where well, the angels singing and joy bell ringing and glory
Well, I wanna know how far am I from Canaan

Lord, when I get on home, my Savior I'll join
Well, I'll shout, God knows I'm gonna dwell, child
Where with the angels singing
Well, Lord, I wanna know how far, child, am I from Canaan
