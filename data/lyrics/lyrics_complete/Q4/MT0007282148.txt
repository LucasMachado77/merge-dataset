The lilies will have grown
By the time you come home
Home from Brazil
Please come home
Before the flowers have been and gone
We'll be waiting and loving you still

May the sun shine down on you
Dive into the blue
May all your days be sublime
And as the sun goes down
And the starry night surrounds
May you dream white lilies sometime

On the streets of Salvador
You'll love the people
The music and the wine
When your hair hangs down
And you sing some Irish song
May you dream white lilies sometime

May the sun shine down on you
Dive into the blue
May all your days be sublime
And as the sun goes down
And the starry night surrounds
May you dream white lilies sometime
May you dream white lilies sometime
