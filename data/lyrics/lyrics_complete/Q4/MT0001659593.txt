What a situation
Senses gone and left me
Lies are like confetti on the floor

Words are leading nowhere
Delicate and tender
Tender hooks that drive me to despair

Storms are blowing, winds are calling to me

Be my escape, my reward
It is you I adore, see me through
Where there are demons I see angels passing by
The morning after nights before I have tried

When a lover leaves you
Cuts you without knowing (when a lover leaves you)
The world just falls apart beneath your feet

Talk is cheap and useless
Nothing but excuses (nothing but excuses)
Lies are like confetti in my hands

Storms are blowing, winds are calling to me

Be my escape, my reward
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
It is you I adore, see me through

Where there are demons I see angels passing by
The morning after nights before I have tried

Be my escape, my reward
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
It is you I adore, see me through

Where there are demons I see angels passing by
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
The morning after nights before I have tried
Where there are demons I see angels passing by
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
The morning after nights before I have tried

Where there are demons I see angels passing by
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
The morning after nights before I have tried
