Laa-lalala, lalalalalaa, laalalaa
Lalala-lalalaa

One drop of rain doesn't make the sun run away
Don't go breakin' my heart!
One falling leaf doesn't make September in May
Don't go breakin' my heart!

I made a mistake
Now, must you make
A mountain out of a grain of sand?
Don't throw love away
Because I went astray
For a while
Teach my heart how to smile, ohh!

One sad goodbye doesn't mean we can't love again
Don't go breakin' my heart!
My love will last 'til the sky falls down, even then
You'll remain in my heart!

Come to my arms, forevermore
Stay in my arms and give me your love!

Laa-lalala, lalalalalaa, laalalaa
Don't go breakin' my heart!

Laa-lalala, lalalalalaa, laalalaa
Don't go breakin' my heart!
