The hardest thing to do
Is to pay my way and keep you
I get off the red bus
Gotta pay the rent
My head is full of us
And the night we spent
Fight for survival
I gotta be cool
A day in the life of a solitary fool
A day in the life
Oh! this is your time
This is your life
This is your day

Oh! look at the night
These are your stars
They show the way
I feel your heart beat
This is your time
This is your life
This is your day

Baningi Bangangotshane
There are so many (people) they are like blades of grass

Somewhere in Africa
The sun is rising now
Young people work and hustle
To fill the table somehow
City heart-beat, in my ears
Avenue of hope, backstreets of fears
Somewhere inside lies the key
I've got you hidden now
Inside of me

Oh! this is your time
This is your life
This is your day
