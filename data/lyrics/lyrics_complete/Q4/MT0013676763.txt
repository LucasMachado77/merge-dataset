There's a right and a wrong way to praise th'Lord.
And the right way you must you must take
If you wont a friend at the journey's end
Out of debt on that great payday.

Never stop or wait lest you be too late
To inherit the golden crown
You must walk each day in the gospel way
If the works of God be found

Do you love your neighbor as yourself
Do you cheat him not in trade
Would your conscience groan on tomorrow's dawn
Should you meet him on the way?

Never stop or wait lest you be too late
To inherit the golden crown
You must walk each day in the gospel way
If the works of God be found

Never do good deeds for the praise of man
Giving gold that man might see
But in secret give, and in secret pray
He'll reward you openly.

Never stop or wait lest you be too late
To inherit the golden crown
You must walk each day in the gospel way
If the works of God be found

Never stop or wait lest you be too late
To inherit the golden crown
You must walk each day in the gospel way
If the works of God be found
