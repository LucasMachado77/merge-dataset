Looking up through the clouds of my imagination
These doctrines of delusion don't deliver
The children bear the traces
Of a thousand years of fear

Even true love - true love
Breathes fire onto mirrors
Find me at the gates of wisdom
Questions falling, falling on deaf ears

So I set my ship out on the waters
Trying to reach faith's holy mount
But the dove I send ahead
Returns with just a hungry seed of doubt
This is the harvest of the world
This is the garden of our works

Winding through the alleyways
In the hour of the wolf
Turn me out on the edge of town
In a field of solid earth

I can't resist the impulse
To sow some wild kind of seed
And reap the ripened fruit
Of all I've grown upon the vines of every deed

This is the harvest of the world
This is the garden of our works

Seeds of doubt grow vines of judgment
Vines of judgment, thorns of blame
Seeds of beauty, fields of wonder
Seeds of anger, blades of shame

Seeds of knowledge, trees of wisdom
Trees of wisdom, fruits of grace
Seeds of tears, vines of forgiveness
Seeds of sorrow bring the wild flowers of faith

Seeds of truthfulness
Grow the tangled roots of feeling
Seeds of joy, the vines of laughter
Fruits of laughter finally bring the wine of healing
