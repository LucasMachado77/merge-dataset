Blue light guitars and a tropical breeze
Hummin' birds mime the words as they dance in the trees
It's a flashback kind of crowd
It's a cabaret sound
There's still some magic left in this tourist town

Those crazy days
And crazy ways
We never want to undo
We'll be together
Now and forever
At the Blue Heaven rendezvous

We're weird roman candles
Burnin' bright at both ends
At the end of the road's
Where this story beings
Where the green of the gulf
Meets the blue of the sea
What makes it all happen's
Still a mystery to me

Those crazy days
And those crazy ways
We never want to undo
We'll be together
Now and forever
At the Blue Heaven rendezvous

If these walls could talk
I don't know what they'd say
They've seen some accidental masquerades
But it's no surprise
Dances 'til dawn
Heroes long gone
Let that guitar play

We'll be together
Now and forever
At the Blue Heaven rendezvous

We'll be together
Now and forever
At the Blue, Blue Heaven rendezvo
