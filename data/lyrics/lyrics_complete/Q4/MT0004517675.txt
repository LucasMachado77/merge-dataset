Winter snow is falling down, children laughing all around.
Lights are turnin' on, like a fairy tale come true.
Sitting by the fire we made, you're the answer when I prayed
I would find some one, and baby I found you.

And all I want is to hold you forever.
All I need is you more everyday.
You saved my heart from being broken apart,
you gave your love away,
and I'm thankful everyday for the gift.

Watching as you softly sleep,what I'd give if I could keep
just this moment, if only time stood still.
But the colors fade away, and the years will make us gray,
but baby in my eyes, you'll still be beautiful.

And all I want is to hold you forever.
All I need is you more everyday.
You saved my heart from being broken apart.
You gave your love away,
and I'm thankful everyday for the gift.

All I want is to hold you forever.
All I need is you more everyday.
You saved my heart from being broken apart.
You gave your love away,
Can't find the words to say
And I'm thankful everyday for the gift
