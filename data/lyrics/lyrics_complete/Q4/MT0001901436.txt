If I die tonight
I'd go with no regrets
If it's in your arms
I know that I was blessed
And if your eyes are the last thing that I see
Then I know the beauty heaven holds for me
But if I make it through
If I live to see the day
If I'm with you I'll know just what to say
The truth be told
Girl, you take my breath away
Every minute, every hour, every day

'Cause every moment we share together
Is even better than the moment before
If every day was as good as today was
Then I can't wait until tomorrow comes

A moment in time is all that's given you and me
A moment in time and it's something you should seize
So I won't make (I won't make)
The mistake of letting go
Every day you're here I'm gonna let you know

'Cause every moment we share together
Is even better than the moment before
If every day was as good as today was
Then I can't wait until tomorrow comes

Each morning that I get up
(Each morning I'll wait)
I love you more than ever
(I love you more)
So, girl, I'll never go away
Never stray

So every moment we share together
Is even better than the moment before
If every day was as good as today was
Then I can't wait until tomorrow comes
Every moment we share together
Is even better than the moment before
If every day was as good as today was
Then I can't wait until tomorrow comes

I love, love, love the moments (Ooh yeah)
Moments we share together (Every moment)
I love, love, love the moments (Ooh yeah)
I pray they'd last forever (Every moment)
I love, love, love the moments (Ooh yeah)
Moments we share together (Every moment)
I love, love, love the moments (Ooh yeah)
I pray they'd last forever
