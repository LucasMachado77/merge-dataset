Hey, time won't wait
Life goes by
Every day's a brand new sky
Every tear comes to dry
All that really matters in this crazy world
Is you and I together, baby just remember...

The first leaves of the tree
The way you look at me
A thousand chiming church bells ring
The simple things are free
The sun, the moon, the stars
The beating of two hearts
How I love the simple things
The simple things just are

So here we go
Let's just dance
Teach my soul to take this chance
Put my heart in your hands
Out of all the moments that we leave behind
Turn around and tell me baby we'll remember...

The thunder and the rain
The way you say my name
After all the clouds go by the simple things remain
The sun, the moon, the stars
The beating of two hearts
How I love the simple things
The simple things just are
Oh, The ocean and the sky
The way we feel tonight
I know that it's the love that brings the simple things to light
The sun, the moon, the stars
The beating of two hearts
I love the way the simple things
The simple things just are
