Desire me, desire me
As I desire you
Desire me and want me
That's all I ever ask of life
That you will someday come to me
And say that you love me
As I love you
Hmm

Desire me and tell me
That you are mine and mine alone
Desire me and love me
And be the queen upon my throne
For I will always worship you
No matter where you go or what you do

There comes a time in the life of every boy
When one and only one girl will do
So now the time has come
And I know that you're the one
And all that I will ever want is you

So desire me desire me
That's all I ever ask of you
Desire me and love and tell me that you want me too
For nothing else will matter in the world
As long as I am close to you

There comes a time
In the life of every boy
When one and only one girl will do
So now the time has come
And I know that you're the one
And all that I will ever want is you
So now the time has come
And I know you are the one
And all that I will ever want is you
