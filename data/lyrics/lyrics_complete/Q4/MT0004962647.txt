In the bleak midwinter
Frosty winds made moan
Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone
Snow had fallen
Snow on snow
Snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter
Long ago

Angels and archangels
May have gathered there
Cherubim and Seraphim
Thronged the air
But His mother only
In her maiden bliss
Worshiped the Beloved
With a kiss

Oh, What can I give Him
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
Would I bring a lamb?
If I were a wise man
Would I do my part
Yet what I can I give Him
Give my heart

In the bleak midwinter
Frosty winds made moan
Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone
If I were a wise man
Would I do my part?
Yet what I can I give Him
Give my heart
