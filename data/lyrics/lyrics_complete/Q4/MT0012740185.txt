Listen to me, Sophia
Have you any idea
How much you mean to me-a?
How much you'll never know
If I'm all agitato
Every heart string vibrato
Every look passionato
Who but you made me so?

It's love, it's love crescendo
Never ever diminuendo
Say the word, sweet Sophia
Or from earth I resign
Oh, Sophia, be mine

Listen to me, Sophia
Have you any idea
How much you mean to me-a?
Every day and more and more
All the others were so-so
Not a one amoroso
But with you I'm aglow, so
Only you I adore

You're sweeter than spumone
Sweeter even than Zabaglione
Say the word, sweet Sophia
Or from earth I resign
Oh, Sophia, be mine
Oh, Sophia, be mine
