Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell
Nowell, Nowell

The first Nowell the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell
Born is the King of Israel

This by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell
Born is the King of Israel
Oh, Nowell
