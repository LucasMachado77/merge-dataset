You sure you want to be with me
I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this love is best
Leave us in emotional peace
Take a walk, taste the rest
No, take a rest

I see you digging a hole
Your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
No need to live on the need to
Your troubles must be seen to see through money
Like it's paper with faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it seldom cools my temper
It never cools my temper

Walking through the suburbs they're not exactly lovers
You're a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Duplicate, and then you wait for the next Kuwait

You sure you want to be with me
I've nothing to give
Take a walk take a rest
Taste the rest

You sure you want to be with me
I've nothing to give
Take a walk take a rest
Taste the rest

Take a walk take a rest
Taste the rest

Don't want to be on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed
We overcome in 60 seconds
With the strength we have together
But for now, emotional ties they stay severed
When there's trust there'll be treats and
When we funk we'll hear be beats

Deflowering my baby, aiyee my baby me
I must be crazy, see I'm swazy
Digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy, must be lazy

Don't wanna on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed

Deflowering my baby, aiyee my baby me
My baby
Deflowering my baby, aiyee my baby me
I must be crazy, you must be lazy
