You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list, he's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town, here he comes

Now the kids in girl and boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land town
All around the Christmas tree

So you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa's coming to town
