Whoopie ti-yi-yo
Get along little dogies
Well it's your misfortune and not of my own
Whoopie ti-yi-yo
Get along little dogies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home

That cattle trail's rough
It's a hard road to travel
That old jack of diamonds is a hard card to play
Whoopie ti-yi-yo
Get along little dogies
Get along little dogies
And be on your way

Whoopie ti-yi-yo
Get along little dogies
It's your misfortune and not of my own
Whoopie ti-yi-yo
Get along little dogies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home
Some boys will hit this old calf-trail for pleasure
But that's where they get it most awfully wrong
I wish I could tell you the troubles they give us
As we go rolling these dogies along

Whoopie ti-yi-yo
Get along little dogies
It's your misfortune and not of my own
Whoopie ti-yi-yo
Get along little dogies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home
