Once like a bird in prison I dwelt
No freedom from my sorrow I felt
But Jesus came and listened to me
And glory to God He set me free

He set me free yes He set me free
And He broke the bonds of prison for me
I'm glory bound my Jesus to see

For glory to God He set me free

Now I am climbing higher each day
Darkness of mine has drifted away
My feet are planted on higher ground
And glory to God I'm homeward bound
