I'm doing
My Christmas dreaming
A little early this year
No sign of snow around
And yet I go around
Hearing jingle bells
Ringing in my ear

Your promise
Must be the reason
The happy season is here
So I'm doing
My Christmas dreaming
A little early this year

Your promise must be reason
The happy season is here
So I'm doing
My Christmas dreaming
A little early this year
