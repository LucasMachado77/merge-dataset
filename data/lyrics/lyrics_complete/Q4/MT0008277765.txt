Call me

Ball me

Turn it around
Tape your secrets down
My sex is tight
Like my record sounds
Remember how we used to keep underground
Now I'm at the circus with my dictaphone
Takin', notes baby how your body cream
How deep I need to push to hear you scream my name
My data's all booted up your mainframe
I need a little rub to keep my beats tame

So we sing
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar

Call me
What the weather like?
Ball me

2000 and 10 parties jam starts kickin'
So I follow the flow and trail to the kitchen
What's this? Why these buggaz twitchin?
Don't feed rails to the heads of a chicken
Finger lickin', tryin' to call my bluff
So I had to throw the out by their scruffs
H-A-R Mar ain't bein' tough
So I ice a Jameson and chase with a bud

H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar
Call me
What the weather like?
Ball me

Your Dj friends are super fucking lame
Otherwise they'd be livin' out the game
Like me
I've seen them all waitering
I'll take a hot sake and a chefs choice plate

Don't hate and don't forget my Nesso
I'll have you cut from your job like Duriso
You can play the saint mother Turisso
While I sip a Wanderers with your chica

And we sing
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar

Call me
What the weather like?
Ball me

One more time
H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar

H-A-R-M-A-R Superstar

Call me
What the weather like?
Ball me
And we're out
