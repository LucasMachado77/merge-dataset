I never held someone so close
That it felt any better
Had a kiss layed on my lips
That I could taste forever
Why is it all good things must come to an end

I never had layed down my side
Someone so warm and tender
Layed eyes on eyes so big and blue
You'd always remember
Why's it all good things must come to

An end you didn't want it to god knows why it did
You asked yourself a million times
As long...as you live...
Why is it all good things must come to an end
I never seen a smile that held my heart so captivated
A touch that made me want it more
Longer than it waited
Why is it all good things must come to
I never thought id see the day
That time just stood there still
Watched my life just drive away
My world behind the wheel
Why is it all good things must come to

An end you didn't want it to god knows why it did
You asked yourself a million times
As long...as you live...
