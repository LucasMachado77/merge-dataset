I know where the cops hang out
When I come home late at night
So then, I know when
To cruise or take it light
I know, I know

I know when the radio's wrong
And when the weather man is jive
I've seen the news
Still it's good to be alive
I know, I know

And I know that the church bells ring
On the Sundays in this town
And I know enough to come indoors
When the rain is pouring down

And I know if you left me here
I would be a poorer man
This world with you
Is a place I understand
I know, I know

And I know if I had my way
I would never end this ride
These hills will do
If you need a place to hide
I know, I know
