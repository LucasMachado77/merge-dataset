Ingenuity my secret rival
Fly, fly, and I am waiting
She said, he said
Just someone, and

But it's slowly turning 'round
You keep hearing, every sound
Running into mines and fires
Laughing at the situation
Like spies
Like spies in the wire
Dark eyes in the wire
Like spies in the wire

Catch a mirror, the lines are dancing
Like a mirror, it's growing faceless
Find a way, the special service
Keep it down, keep it harmless
Like spies
Like spies in the wire
Dark eyes in the wire
Like spies in the wire
Ingenuity finds secret rival
Fight the fire, and I am waiting
She said, he said
Just start, that heart
Like spies
Like spies in the wire
Dark eyes in the wire
Like spies in the wire
Like spies in the wire

Catch at work, the lines are dancing
Like a mirror, it's growing faceless
Find a way, the special service
Keep it round, keep it harmless
Like spies
Like spies in the wire
Dark eyes in the wire
Like spies in the wire
Like spies in the wire
Like spies in the wire
