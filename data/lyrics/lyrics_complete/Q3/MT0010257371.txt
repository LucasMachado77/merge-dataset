Darling, you're mistaken I don't like what's going on
But tell you too much conversation won't get you off
You said, "Blackie's dead...Blackie's dead," and then run the other way

I don't want to tell you that you're not there on my list
And what's with all that shit you're saying
No, you're not interested in this

I'm in love with a girl, sees what you are (what you are)
Tell, tell them you know, tell them your great big poem
Yeah, always feel the pressure from home

Darling, we will visit, you know you don't feel this way
What's with all that information, oh, don't give it away
You said, "Blackie's dead...Blackie's dead," and then run the other way

I'm in love with a girl, sees what you are (what you are)
Tell, tell them you know, tell them you're great big poem
I'm in love with a girl, sees what you are (what you are)

Tell, tell them you know, tell them your great big poem
Yeah, always feel the pressure from home

I'm in love with a girl, sees what you are (what you are)
Tell, tell them you know, tell them your great big poem

I'm in love with a girl, sees what you are (what you are)
Tell...tell them you know, tell them your great big poem
Yeah, always feel the pressure from home

Darling, you're forgiven I don't like what's going on
