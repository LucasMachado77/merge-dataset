That hurts
Your baby told you it was over
And I'm just a friendly shoulder you can cry on
While I ache to take you into my arms
Of all the dreams in all the world
There's nothing worse
Than meant to be and you don't see

That I wanted to be the one to make your knees weak
Your hands shake
I wanted to be the one that you woke up to
Held on to
But I never knew that touch
And you'll never know how much
That hurts

It's not fair
I have to be the great pretender
As if I don't remember all those sad prayers
That sounded good but got me nowhere
Of all the jokes in all the world
How sad is this
To be so close and not let it show

That I wanted to be the one to make your knees weak
Your hands shake
I wanted to be the one that you woke up to
Held on to
But I never knew that touch
And you'll never know how much
That hurts

Oh I wanted to be the one to make your knees weak
Your hands shake
I wanted to be the one that you woke up to
Held on to
But I never knew that touch
And I wanted you so
But I have to let go
And you'll never know how much that hurts
