I just came in here from force of habit
I don't intend to spend too much time in here
But I saw you heading for the jukebox
And if you play A-11, there'll be tears

I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A-11

Oh, this used to be our favorite nightspot
And when she was here, it was heaven
It was here she told me that she loved me
And she always played A-11

I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A-11
Please don't play A-11
