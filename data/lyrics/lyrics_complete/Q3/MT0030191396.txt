So this is love I've never been here before
And when I leave I won't come back anymore
For everything I've met since I've been here has only brought me pain
So when I leave I won't come back again

Well here I am on the corner of Heart and Mind
And the citizens of love are running blind
Reckon one another's hearts and cryin' all the while
Just like pain was goin' out of style
So this is love...

Where shoud I go from the corner of Heart and Mind
Love is in the state of confusion all the time
Heartaches are always present makes no difference where you turn
And the taxes take what happiness you earn
So this is love...
So when I leave I won't come back again
So when I leave I won't come back again
