I've forgotten more
Than you'll ever know about him

You think you know the smile on his lips
The thrill at the touch of his fingertips
But I've forgotten more
Than you'll ever know about him

You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
In each caress each tender kiss
But I've forgotten more
Than you'll ever know about him

You stole his love from me one day
You didn't care how you hurt me
But you can never steal away
Memories of what used to be
You think he's yours to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn when his love grows cold
That I've forgotten more about him
Than you'll ever know about him

You think he's yours to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn when his love grows cold
But I've forgotten more
Than you'll ever know about him
