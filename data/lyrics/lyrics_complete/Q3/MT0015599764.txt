This one here go out to the only lady of my life
Ria Maria
Our moms man
I see you ma
You can shine to this one ma

I remember listen to my dad
We was young age
Papa writing letters from the jail sail
Where's daddy
He's neva 'round
During father's day at school he neva 'round (yeah)
I hope he listenin
I hate him for that
He broke your arm
Broke your heart
Can't forgive him for that
Any man with a dick
Could bring to seed to life
But only
A real man takes care to see his wife
You were pussy hell Armstrong
Don't forget that
You know where we live now
Were the monthly checks at
Momma been there through the loops and stripes
Only a man could raise a man
So what's my future like
Momma thanks for making sure we was loved
When you was hospitalized
Making sure we was hugged
So go ahead and do your thang
Ma is your time to show the world you shine pretty mama of mine

You know how beautiful you are
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go 'head and shine
Pretty mama of mine

You know how beautiful you are
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go 'head and shine
Pretty mama of mine

I used to think life wasn't so fair
When you was bed written
No teeth no hair
'Cause you showed us the roads when we was younger
Gave us what you could
And supplied to our hunger
And pops left you with nothing but scars and bad memories
Though your soul was dead you still had energy
He cheated on me
Beat you with no warning
And left us for there when the moth came home
But by the time the wounds healed
You didn't though
But we had to grow up for you to tell us it all
And is clear now
He didn't love you at all
But we did
So that there covered it all
Now is yo turn to shine
I gotta let the story retold
'Cause you was there though the sleep and the snow
And the hard times still fresh in my mind
So this song is for you pretty momma of mine

You know how beautiful you are
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go 'head and shine
Pretty mama of mine

You know how beautiful you are
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go 'head and shine
Pretty mama of mine

Through the brain cancer

with the help of god
and helped our prayer
