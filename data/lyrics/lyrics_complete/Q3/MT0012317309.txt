I made a long day, walkin' 'long and crying,
I lost my baby, can't be satisfied,
So when I'm gone, gal take it easy, cos I'm just worryin' you off my mind
When ya get in trouble, haven't got a friend,
Just take it easy, they'll need your help again,
So when I'm gone, gal take it easy, cos I'm just worryin' you off my mind

Now it ain't hard, to live alone,
Just hard to be married, and break up your home,
So when I'm gone, gal take it easy, cos I'm just worryin' you off my mind
But that's alright, that's alright for you,
You need me some morning, when I won't need you,
So when I'm gone, gal take it easy, cos I'm just worryin' you off my mind

When I was down, lost my wife and my friends,
When I got my money, they all come back again,
So when I'm gone, gal take it easy, I'm just worryin' you off my mind
(One mornin') pretty women, runnin' hand in hand,
When they raise no squabble, takin' some woman('s) man,
So when I'm gone, gal take it easy, cos I'm just worryin' you off my mind
