I've been afraid
And I've been misled
I've been hit in the head
And I've been left for dead

I've been accused
And I've been abused
I've been refused
I've been refused a piece of bread

But I tell you I never
Never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs
Go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop
Find out what's wrong
Get it right
Or just leave love alone

Because the love you save today
May very well be your own

I've been pushed around
And I've been lost and found
I've been given till sundown
To get out of town
I've been taken outside
And I've been brutalized
And I always had to be the one
To apologize

But I tell you I never
No no never, no no never
Never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs
Go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop
Find out what's wrong
Get it right
Or, please, leave love alone

Because the love you save today
May very well be your own
May very well be your own
May very well be your own
