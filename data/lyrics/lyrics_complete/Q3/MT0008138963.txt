Just let my baby
Try not to care
Got a mountain of misery
Just too much to bear

Her kiss like honey
So warm and sweet
Her heart decieved me
She was a cheat

Blond hair can fool you
Blue eyes can too
Cruel lips can tell black lies
Break your heart for you

The days are lonely
Can't sleep or eat
My one and only
She was a cheat

Wise men will tell me

To leave was right
Wise men do cry alone
All through the night

When I am walking
Down some dark street
Shadows still whisper
She was a cheat

Wise men will tell me
To leave was right
Wise men do cry alone
All through the night

When I am walking
Down some dark street
Shadows still whisper
She was a cheat
