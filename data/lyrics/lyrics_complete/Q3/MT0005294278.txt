Love me or leave me
And let me be lonely
You won't believe me
And I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Then happy with somebody else

You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'
With somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow
To have it today and give back tomorrow
Your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else

Love me or leave me
And let me be lonely
You won't believe me
And I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'
With somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow
To have it today and give back tomorrow
Your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else
