Hey, where's your girl
Hey, where'd she go
Did she just get tired
Did she just get old
Like a beat up doll
Did you throw her away
Dumped on the street
Near the big highway
Yeah

You were so tall
You were so fine
That they all came back
They all fell in line
You were the one
And you took control
And they all bent down
And they lost their souls
Yeah
We're going inside
We're going inside
We're going inside
We're going inside
We're going inside
We're going inside
We're going inside

Going inside
