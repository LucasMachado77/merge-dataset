Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Tryin' times, what the world is talkin' about
You got confusion all over the land, yeah
You got mother against daughter, you got father against son
You know the whole thing is getting out of hand

Then maybe folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love for your brother
But these are tryin' times, yeah, yeah

You got the riots in the ghetto, it's all around
A whole lot of things that's wrong is going down, yes, it is
I can't understand it from my point of view
'Cause I think you should do unto others
As you'd have them do unto you

Then maybe folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love for your brother
But these are tryin' times, yes, it is

I said man is always talking 'bout it's inhumanity to man
But what is he tryin' to do to make it a better man?
Oh, just read the paper, turn on your TV
You see folks demonstrating about equality

But maybe folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love for your brother
But these are tryin' times

Tryin' times, yeah, that's what the world is talkin' about
You got confusion all over the land
