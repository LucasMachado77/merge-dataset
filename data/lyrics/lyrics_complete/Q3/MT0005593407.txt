Well, I done got old
I caint do the thangs I used to do
I'm a old man

Well, I done got old
I caint do the thangs I used to do
I'm a old man

Remember the day, Babe
Now dead and gone
Days I could love you
So many times
Now things have changed
And I done got old
I caint do the thangs I used to do
I'm a old man

I don' look like I used
Can't walk like I used
Cain't love like I used
Now things have changed
And I done got old
I caint do the thangs I used to do
I'm a old man
