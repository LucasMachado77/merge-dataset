You can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with 
And all I wanted was a love to stay

If you get, the wrong woman 
There's only one thing that you can do
Just dig a hole and jump right in it
Then pull the ground right over you

Ah, you can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay

The girl I love, she up and left me
She ran away with my best friend
She comes home at night just for an hour 
When day light comes she's gone again

Yes, you can have her, (you can have her) 
I don't, I don't really want her (I don't want her)
She didn't love me (she didn't love me) anyway
She only wanted (only wanted) 
Someone to play with (someone to play with)
But all I wanted was a love to stay

Life without love, it's mighty empty
Confession is good, it's good for the soul
I'd rather have love that I can cling to 
Than to have the world and all of its gold

Yes, you can have her, (you can have her) 
I don't, I don't really want her (I don't want her)
She didn't love me (she didn't love me) anyway
She only wanted (only wanted) 
Someone to play with (someone to play with)
But all I wanted was a love to stay

Yes, you can have her, (you can have her, I don't really want her (I don't want her)
She didn't love me (she didn't love me) anyway
She only wanted (only wanted) someone to play with
