Well you said you loved me and I started laughing.
You told me that you need me, but I kept on laughing.
You vowed that you wanted me, but I was still laughing at you.

I learned to love you and you started laughing.
I told you that I needed you, but you kept on laughing.
I found that I wanted you, now everyone is laughing at me.

Laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone.
I hear the whole world laughing and I'm sitting here all alone.

How could you be so cruel? But OK keep on laughing.
They know that I've been one big fool, now everyone is laughing.
Next time I'll play it cool and they'll not be laughing at me.
