Her innocence above me
Today is dead she's around my head
Between my history between my headphones
This is her home forever her home

But i can't be her brother
To empower her to become her
Trawl through this forgiveness
My memory's so empathy low

This attitude beneath her
It's evident it denies us
Proves herself to be closer
But not me forever not me

This sickness avoids all cure
Imperfection my downfall
Learn myself through symptoms
My memory's so
Empathy low
