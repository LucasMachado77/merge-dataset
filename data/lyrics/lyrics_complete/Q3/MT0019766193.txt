Everyone on the outside
You've gotta get together and go inside
You gotta go inside
C'mon, you've gotta, not much time

What's real, what's fake
It's hard to relate
It's impulse, it's all you can trust

It's girls and beer, that's all I hear
Can't get enough of
Of this American thing

And we should all give up and never look back
Like the road you know and just let go
And wish you all good luck and never look back
Like the road you know and just let go

In a modern world, it's hard to be heard
In a modern world, it's hard

A dotted line, a cigarette
Fill in the blank with my silhouette
It's impulse, it's all you can trust

And wish you good luck and never look back
Like the road you know and just let go

In a modern world, it's hard to be heard
In a modern world, it's hard
In a modern world, it's hard to use words
In a modern world, it's hard

There are so many of them
But there are so many of us too
Call everybody you know
Text everybody you know
Tell them to meet us up on top of the walls

Put my head in a box
Pack it up and ship it off
Put my head in a can
Pack it up and tell them who I am

In a modern world, it's hard to be heard
In a modern world, it's hard
In a modern world, it's hard to use words
In a modern world, it's hard

Pack it up and ship it off
Put my head in a can
Pack it up and tell them who I am
Pack it up and tell them who I am
