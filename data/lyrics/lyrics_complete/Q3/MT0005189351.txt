And I can see you wantin' more
Inside your eyes
Are tellin' me what you're looking for
A love that's true
Someone that you can lean on
To pull you through
Well, baby, I will be the one

I wanna be the one in your life
I wanna be the one by your side
I wanna be the one to show you
Oh, baby, you should be mine
Don't want us to make a mistake
Don't ever want to see your heart break
I can't let you go this time
Oh, baby, you should be mine

Ohh, you should be mine
Ohh

It's been so long
Since real love has looked your way
But hold on, be strong
It doesn't have to be a game we play
'Cause I hear you say
How a heartache can feel
But now today
You've finally found a love that's really real

I wanna be the one in your life
I wanna be the one by your side
I wanna be the one to show you
Oh, baby, you should be mine
Don't want us to make a mistake
Don't ever want to see your heart break, yeah
I can't let you go this time
Oh, baby, you should be mine

Ohh, be mine
Ohh, and mine

I know just what you're going through
You're never sure just who
Who might be hurting you
But let me be the one to hold you tight
Make everything alright
'Cause you should be mine tonight, oh yeah

I wanna be the one in your life
I wanna be the one by your side
I wanna be the one to show you
Oh, baby, you should be mine, yeah
Don't want us to make a mistake, oh no
Don't ever want to see your heart break, yeah
I can't let you go this time
Oh, baby, you should be mine

I wanna be the one in your life
I wanna be the one by your side
I wanna be the one to show you
Oh, baby, you should be mine
Don't want us to make a mistake
Don't ever want to see your heart break
I can't let you go this time
Oh, baby, you should be mine

And I can see you wantin' more
Inside your eyes
