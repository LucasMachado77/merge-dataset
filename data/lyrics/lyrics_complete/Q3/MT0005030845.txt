I begged her to stay and give me one more try
And she said it's over, and she said goodbye
Now I'm at this bar, tryin' to wash away my pain
But every time I hear the jukebox, the tears fall like rain

They oughta put warning labels on those sad country songs
Harmful, to your heart when you're left all alone
And if you're drinkin' you'll start thinkin' bout love that went wrong
They oughta put warning labels on those sad country songs

They warn me 'bout cigarettes, whiskey and beer
No one ever warned me about the music I hear
I don't guess I would listen to what they said anyway
But at least I'd been ready when the first sad song played

There's nothing harder on my heart than ol' Haggard and Jones
They oughta put warning labels on those sad country songs
