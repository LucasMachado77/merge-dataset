It's hard to be lonely, feel everyone is down on you
It's hard to be lonely, feel everyone is down on you
Then you find out later on that they care so much for you

There's no need to worry, one day things'll come your way
Ain't no need to worry, one day things'll come your way
I heard my baby say it so often, where there's a will, there is a way

I know I was wrong, baby, honey, the way I doubted you
Well, I know I was wrong, honey, girl, the way I doubted you
Well, if you forgive me, 'give me baby, from now on I'll listen to you
