Supper time
I should set the table
'Cause it's supper time
Somehow I'm not able
'Cause that man o'mine
Ain't comin' home no more

Supper time
Kids will soon be yellin'
For their supper time
How'll I keep from tellin'
Them that man o'mine
Ain't comin' home no more?

How'll I keep explainin'
When they ask me where he's gone?
How'll I keep from cryin'
When I bring their supper on?
How can I remind them to
Pray at their humble board?
How can I be thankful
When they start to thank the Lord
Lord!

Supper time
I should set the table
'Cause it's supper time
Somehow I'm not able
'Cause that man o'mine
Ain't comin' home no more
