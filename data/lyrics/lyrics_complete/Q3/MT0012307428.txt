Yes, I rolled an I rolled
An I tried the whole night long
Yes, I rolled an I rolled
An I tried the whole night long
I woke up this mo'nin
Didn't know right from wrong

Lord, I told my baby
Before I left this town
Lord, I told my baby
'Fore I left this town
Lord, don't let nobody
Tear my barrel house down
Lord, I walked an I walked
An cried the whole day long
Yes, I did

Yes, I walked an I walked
An I cried the whole day long
I didn't have nobody
To tell my trouble to

Yes, a long time!

And you never blow the whistle
And no fireman rung the bell

Bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom!
