You're gonna need,
You're gonna need my help, I say.
You know I won't have to worry,
I'll have everything goin' my way.

Well, you wake up in the morning,
Your face so full of frowns.
Asked you, "What's wrong?"
You say, "I'm sorry, I'm puttin' you down!"

Well, you're gonna need,
You're gonna need my help, I say.
You know I won't have to worry,
Coz' I'll have everything goin' my way.

Well, you leave home in the morning
And you won't come back tonight.
You won't give me no food
You still say you treat me right.
