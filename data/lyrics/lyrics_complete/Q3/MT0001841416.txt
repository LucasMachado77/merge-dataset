Yes, I said, go bring me my shotgun
Oh, bring me back some shells
Yes, I said, go bring me my shotgun
Oh, bring me back a pocket full of shells

Yes, if I don't get some competition
You know there's gonna be trouble here

Yes, you know my woman tried to quit me
When I ain't done nothin' wrong
She done put me out of doors
But I even ain't got no home as it goes
Bring me my shotgun
Oh Lord, and a pocket full of shells
Yes, if I don't get some competition
You know there's gotta be trouble here

Yes, you know that my momma told me
The day that I left the door
She said, "I ain't gonna have bad luck, son
And I don't care where you go"

Just bring me my shotgun
Boy, you can bring just one or two shells
Yes, if I don't get some competition
You know there's gotta be trouble here

I'm gonna play it just a minute right now

Well, I cried, "Bye-bye, baby
You know you done me wrong"
I'm gonna take my little shotgun now
And I'm gonna carry it back home

I said one in the morning
I'm gonna carry my shotgun home
Yes, I figure the best thing I can do
Why did I leave that woman alone?
