Hard workin' Hanna, honey, I heard about yo' game
Hard workin' Hanna, honey, I've heard about yo' game
You know I still need ya', pretty baby, honey, to help me do my thang

Hard workin' Hanna, honey, please don't be so strong
Hard workin' Hanna, ooh, honey, please don't be so strong
Honey, let Jimmy down easy, 'cause I know you're gonna do me wrong
