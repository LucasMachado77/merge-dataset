Slow walkin' mama, you been makin' a fool of me
Slow walkin' mama, you been makin' a fool out of me
Takin' all of my money, honey, given it to your "used to be"

No more, honey I can tell ya, no more
No more, Jimmy here to tell you, no more
Got too many horses in your stall, honey, oh yes, somebody got to go

When it come to your woman, man, man, you don't even have a friend
When it come down to your woman,
I'm here to tell you, you ain't got a friend
There is nothin' worser than a cacklin' rooster, oh yeah, a crowin' hen
