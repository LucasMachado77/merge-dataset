I was sitting in a station one day
When I heard a splendid young lad say
"I've no money for my fare, but I'm longing to be there
And a letter from my sister tells me this:
'Mother's dying, please come home at once
If you want a mother's farewell kiss'"

Was my mother's farewell kiss I now remember
How I'd (love/like) to see her smiling face once more
With her hand upon my brow, I can feel her touch just now
'Tis a memory of my mother's farewell kiss
'Tis a memory of my mother's farewell kiss

As the train pulled in that day
From behind the lad a voice replied
"Take this money, pay your fare, it's enough to get you there
It's a twenty dollar bill I'll never miss"
So the lad came safely home in time
To receive the mother's farewell kiss
