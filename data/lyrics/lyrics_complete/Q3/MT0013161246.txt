You've found a new love
That you say is divine
I'm so glad for your sake
So sorry for mine

I hear you say
It's the real thing this time
I'm so glad for your sake
So sorry for mine

And though it hurts my pride
To have to step aside
What can I do
Taking my place with you

But if you're happy
I don't mind if I cry
So glad for your sake
So sorry for mine

And though it hurts my pride
To have to step aside
What can I do
Taking my place with you

But if you're happy
I don't mind if I cry
So glad for your sake
So sorry for mine
