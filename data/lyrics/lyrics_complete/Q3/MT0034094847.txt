Last night she made it plain she didn't want me
Today I woke later and alone
Tomorrow i'll be turning' to the bottle
Tonight i'll be cold and all alone

She only broke my heart lord, not my spirit
She only took my body, not my soul
My skin still burns in places where she touched me
And when she touched me lord, I lost my self-control

When she's got me where she wants me
She don't want me
I'm just another game she likes to play
I don't think I can make it through tomorrow
I almost never made it through today

She sure knew how to love me, when she loved me
When I was weak she always come on strong
She knew just what it took to drive me crazy
And she knew how much I hate to be alone

When she's got me where she wants me
