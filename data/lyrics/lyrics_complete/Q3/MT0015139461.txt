Yo, yo, what up?
I know it's you
I had to run out and pick up a few things
If you get to the crib before I get back, you know what to do
Whatever is yours
Oh, yeah, I got a surprise for ya
Ha ha, it's gonna be sweet
So, I gotta run, peace, I'm out
I love ya

Well, here I go in the wind
Got to face rockin' on the sound, got my phone in my hand
My baby hit me two times
I gotta hit her back, she says she's flyin' in tonight
See, my baby's been gone for so long
She's back in town it's time to get it on
She told me she would meet me at my spot about eight
That gives two whole hours to get my shit straight
I hit my place around six
It's most time to see her, almost time to get my fix
I just can't wait to see my baby's face
She's not like all these others on the paper chase
She's the kinda girl that you wanna stay true to
There's nothing that this girl wouldn't do for you, no
I think I hear her in my driveway
Open up the door and this and this is what she had to say

"I found someone to do what you used to (No, baby)
Boy, you thought you were deceivin' me, with your infidelity
I found someone who really deserves me, and he's all I need
I'm making my moves, I've found someone new
And I got no more love for you"

How could you go and do this to me baby?
Since you hit town, you had me running around, actin' crazy
And had I known you'd treat me this way
We had to swing this drama for another day, baby
This was your night, the room was on, beepers on
My shit was tight, you blew it, baby, now it's blown
And after all I've done for you
You messed around and blew the best thing that ever happened to you, baby

Now don't go and put this all on me
Since I left town, you've been tryin' to run down with every girl you see
I can't believe you'd do this to me, ohh baby
I heard about your friend with the red dress
Now why you wanna go and play a game you can't win?
You didn't know she was my best friend
And now we're all up in your pockets for your Benjamin's

"I found someone to, do what you used to (No, baby)
Boy, you thought you were deceivin' me, with your infidelity
I found someone who really deserves me, and he's all I need
I'm making my moves
I found someone new and got no more love for you
I found someone to do what you used to
Boy, you thought you were deceivin' me, with your infidelity
(No, no, no)
I found someone who really deserves me, and he's all I need
I'm making my moves
I found someone new and got no more love for you
I'm making my moves
I found someone new and got no more love for you"

Don't leave me, baby
Said I love you, baby
Said I need you, baby
Stay right here with me, baby
Ohh
