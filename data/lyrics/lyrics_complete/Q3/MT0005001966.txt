Don't fade away
My brown eyed girl
Come walk with me
I'll fill your heart with joy

And we'll dance through our isolation
Seeking solace in the wisdom we bestow
Turning thoughts to the here and ever after
Consuming fears in our fiery halos

Say what you mean
Mean what you say
I've heard that innocence
Has led us all astray

But don't let them make you and break you
The world is filled with their broken empty dreams
Silence is their only virtue
Locked away inside their silent screams

But for now let us dance away this starry night
Filled with the glow of fiery stars
And with the dawn our sun will rise
Bringing a symphony of bird cries

Don't bring me down now
Let me stay here for a while
You know life's too short
Let me bathe here in your smile
I'm transcending
The fall from the garden

Goodnight
