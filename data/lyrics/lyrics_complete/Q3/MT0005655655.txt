All alone, all alone, got misery so bad, I have to cry
But someday baby, mm
You ain't gonna worry me, my life, anymore

You're on my mind, every place I've gone
How much I love you, no one know
But someday baby, you ain't gonna worry me, my life any more

And on my mind, every place I've gone
Man, I know I love you an' nobody knows
But someday baby, you ain't gonna worry, my mind any more
