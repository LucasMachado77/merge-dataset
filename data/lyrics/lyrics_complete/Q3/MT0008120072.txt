Well, you ride around the town
And stick in town
And you can't to that and be my gal

And I told you, baby
And I told you, baby
I done told you, girl
I ain't gonna tell you no more

You bought your fine dome
To spend my dough
Just wouldn't even try to set aside my dough

And I told you, baby
And I told you, baby
I done told you girl
I ain't gonna tell you no more

I done told you, girl
I ain't gonna tell you no more
