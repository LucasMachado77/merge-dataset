There you go falling in love again
This time it's for real
But you ain't going nowhere you ain't already been
It's like the way it feels
I can get down on my knees and beg you baby
But I ain't got a prayer
So go on and go
And see if I care

See if I care
See if I'll be there
See if I'll be around when he puts you down
To pick you up
See if it's really love
See what he's made of
Go on and go
And see if I care

Girl you found love that makes you feel brand new
You think that I'm not enough
But when he gets old what are you going to do
When that new wears off
You'll be smiling and dialing my number
To see if I'm still there
Give me a call
And see if I care

See if I care
See if I'll be there
See if I'll be around when he puts you down
To pick you up
And see if it's really love
See what he's made of
Go on and go
And see if I care

Oh, give me a call
And see if I care
