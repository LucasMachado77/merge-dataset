It was early one mornin'
I was on my way to school
It was early one mornin'
I was on my way to school
That was the Monday mornin'
I broke my mama's rule

Ooo-wee-wee baby
You sure look good to me
Ooo-wee-wee baby
You sure look good to me
Sometimes I wonder who can your lover be?

In love with ya baby
Before I learned to call your name
In love with ya baby
Before I learned to call your name
You in love with someone else
You 'bout to drive me insane
