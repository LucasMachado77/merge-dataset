Deep down and lonely
Long place from home
I was always a loner
I was never alone

I was always the one
Defeated so
But I tried, and tried
In the darkness to find

Can't stop, stop this feeling
I can't stop this hurting feeling now
It's my heartland

Can't stop, stop this feeling
I can't stop this hurting feeling now
It's my heartland

There's no pretending
I can't deny
I fell through the cracks
When I left you behind

Took the long way round
Came a long way home
Time after time
In the darkness to find
Can't stop, stop this feeling
I can't stop this hurting feeling now
It's my heartland

Can't stop, stop this feeling
I can't stop this hurting feeling now
It's my heartland

...

Can't stop, stop this feeling
I can't stop this hurting feeling now
It's my heartland

Can't stop, stop this feeling
I can't stop this hurting feeling now
It's my heartland

Can't stop, stop this feeling
I can't stop this hurting feeling now
It's my heartland
