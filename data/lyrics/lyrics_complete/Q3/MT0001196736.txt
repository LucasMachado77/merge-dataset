Thought you saw me standing with her in the park
Can't be cause I was planning to be with you
To be with you
You think I'm sneaking but I'm not
This love I have for you is all I've got
No matter what you hear
I need to make it clear
I wanna be with you, be with you
The only one I wanna touch (You)
The only one I wanna love (You)
Tell me that you feel the same
(Only you)
I love the way you scream my name
(You, you)

You heard me say I love you to her on the line
Not true check your phone
I was calling you

You think I'm cheating but I'm not
This thing I have for you is all I want
No matter what they say
I know I must convey
I want to be with you, only you

The only one I wanna touch (You)
The only one I wanna love (You)
Tell me that you feel the same
(Only you)
I love the way you scream my name
(You, you)

Tell me what you wanna do
Tell me if you think I'm true
Why would I ho around?
I like the way you put it down
I love it when you scream my name
Why you wanna lay the blame?
Do you wanna be with me?
Cause you're the only one I need

The only one I wanna touch (You)
