It's funny how you loved me
Then forgot so suddenly
It's funny to everyone but me

They told me this would happen
Now they're laughing secretly
It's funny to everyone but me

I should shrug my shoulders and say
"Good riddance to a bad affair"
But how can I do, what my head tells me to
When my heart tells me how much I care?

It's so funny I still love you
It's the joke of the century
It's funny to everyone but me

How could I make such a fool mistake?
They're laughing at me all of the time
Honey child, have you ever noticed the delight that they all take
In kicking a man down?
Now I should shrug my shoulders and say
"Well, good riddance to a bad affair"
But darling, how can I do what my head tells me to
When my heart tells me how much I care

Oh, but it's funny I still love you
It's the joke of the century
It's so funny to everyone but me

It's funny, but not to me!
