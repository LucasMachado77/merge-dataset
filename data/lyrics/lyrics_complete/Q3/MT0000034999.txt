I don't believe I'll fall in love today for if I did I know I wouldn't stay
I just can't make my heart find someone new it's always much too busy loving you
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find another in my heart and on my mind
And I'll awake and I'll hear my poor heart say
That I don't believe I'll fall in love today

I don't believe I'll fall in love today old memories of you stand in the way
You'd come between us like you always do
Somehow they'd never measure up to you
Each night I pray...
