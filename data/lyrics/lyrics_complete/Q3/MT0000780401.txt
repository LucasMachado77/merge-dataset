Does it show as I watch her walking by?
Does it show that I'm trying not to cry?
Does it show that he's the reason why?
Does it show that every smile is a lie?
Does it show even when I am discreet?

Does it show I fall right down at her feet?
All on its own, my heart lets me know I'm love's biggest clown
Do you think that shows even when no one is around?

Please, tell me honestly
Am I fooling anyone
Or is the truth kinda hard not to see?

In ways that I'll never know, does it show?

Please, say it's not too late
So I can stop while there's still time
An' avoid me some small bit of ache

Does it show with each flickering memories final glow?
As night's cold shadows wrap around where hope let go
An' I sit there in the dark, does it show?
