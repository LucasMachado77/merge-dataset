I'm goin' to Dallas, see my pony run
Goin' to Dallas, just to see my pony run
I'm goin' to Dallas, just to see my pony run
If I win any money, gonna bring my baby some

She's a cold black mare, put on a racetrack anywhere
She's a cold black mare, put on a racetrack anywhere
If I get to the place and it's crowded
I'll say have you got any room to spare?

I'm goin' to Dallas, see my pony run
Goin' to Dallas, see my pony run
I'm goin' to Dallas, just to see my pony run
She wins every race and I can't see how it's done
She got a long life to live, cold black way remains
Long life to live, cold black way remains
When that horse wins that race
She don't look like she's ashamed

I'm goin' to Dallas, see her run one more time
Goin' to Dallas, see her run one more time
If she wins this race for Lightnin'
I'm gonna tell her she can retire
