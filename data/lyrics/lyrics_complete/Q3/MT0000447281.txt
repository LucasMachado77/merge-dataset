I'm gonna tell all you woman
You better find yourself a man
I'm telling all you woman
You better find yourself a man
Because depression is coming
And you'll need a helping hand

Now all your ponytails
Tee-vee mommas too
Yes you run around here braggin'
What your old man can do
You say he makes plenty money
And spends it on you
But if he can step up
He'll be on the sublime too

Depression blues
All hail depression blues

My poppa stole a chicken
My moma fried it hard
The reason why she did that
He couldn't steal no law

Depression blues
All hail depression blues
Depression blues
All hail depression blues

I'm gonna tell all you woman
You find yourself a man
I'm gonna tell all you woman
You find yourself a man
Because depression is coming
And you gonna need a helping hand
