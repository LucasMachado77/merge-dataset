Charged for murder
First-degree
Fingerprints agree
Searched my home for evidence
Cause for this offense

I am the scapegoat for authorities
A suspect without alibi
Testimonies were utmost doubtful
Still they sentenced me to death

Execution
On the chair
I yield to despair
Visitation
From a priest
Ransom for the beast

Washed my body
Shaved my head
No more tears to shed
Plugged the power
Took my life
Fried my ass at five
