Your thought, my will

Your thought, my will
Melted to one and formed with flesh
My need to hate, a spine of hate
Broken down using my skill
A madman making the change
Tender and smooth, sealing the fate

Divide the evolution of time
Assembling the conerstones of life
You haven't seen anything alike
The soul burned to a crisp
A madman making the change

Part by part
Stone by stone
Forgive my father of life
Shrink it in size
Inserted and fitted for fight
Adapting my brother, my slave
You will become my prize

Acid with acid - piece by piece
I'm putting you together
So beautiful, you'll see
As the world now...
...sleeps

Rise my creature rise
My creature...
...RISE

I fest on the knowledge that I possess
I'm not your god
A madman making the change
The becoming of the future
We become...the dead
Formed into theory
A protein fed to grow
Caring, watching every move
One by one they join
Cornerstones of the body, soon whole
Ways of the future come as one
My creaure in red will now grow:

Acid with acid - piece by piece
I'm putting you together
So beautiful, aou'll see
As the world now sleeps

I'm putting you together
So beautiful, you'll see
I'm putting you together
So beautiful, you'll see
