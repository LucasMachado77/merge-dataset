The king of cool was dragged from his grave
In a cinematic style with a zoom lens, still frame

Perched on gilded litter, abandoned by the night
Hear my soliloquy beneath the dim street lights

Booked on suspicion
Feeling the crush
Booked on suspicion
Outta luck

The tongue of reaction in a vendetta hallway
Twenty-one nights of fear on the killing floor

Booked on suspicion
Feeling the crush
Booked on suspicion
Outta luck

The tongue of reaction in a vendetta hallway
Twenty-one nights of fear on the killing floor

Booked on suspicion
Feeling the crush
Booked on suspicion
Outta luck

Booked on suspicion
Feeling the crush
Booked on suspicion
Outta luck
