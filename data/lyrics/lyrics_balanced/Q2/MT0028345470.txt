Flawed and fragile is your frame
Despair shining through
Bleeding ruins of pain
Fearstairted crust on pale eidolon mask

Sundered soul
In suicide role

Are we not sculptured from misery
Odalisque of designed malaise
Your face is the canvas of scorn
For tragedy to adorn

Strained skin scourged to shreds
Your spine is broken spirit lost
Wretched husk heed behest
Leave the stage for strong to host

Sheltered yet shivering
In drainfall, tamed grin
Nowhether lead hallways dim
But one that reeks of sin

All the gods you pray
Won't steal me woe away
Every stain you carve
Only thrives the scar
No pleasure nor delight
Veil the wound inside
