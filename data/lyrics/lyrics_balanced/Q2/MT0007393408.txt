Twilight open and you're on your own
Moon is shining you want fun and games
Hear the voices inside your head
Let's play wild - volatile

Get out my way - we go
Take back those ways you know
Fun and games come out to play
Fun and games for unknown days

Then you join your playmates in the street
And the night fire's burning and you're on your feet
All the boys and girls - look in their eye
Domestication - lost overnight

Get out my way - we go
Take back those ways you know
Fun and games come out to play
Fun and games for unknown days
Games get bigger all the time
Because the playpens falling - stakes are high
And the child will conquer - step by step
Let's play wild - volatile

Get out my way - we go
Take back those ways you know
Fun and games come out to play
Fun and games for unknown days

Fun and games come out to play
Fun and games
