I've spread my wings
Over Earth
Embraced you all
My kingdom come

Eternal night
So still and dark
Forever last
This is my realm

I am Death - horseman the fourth
I am Death - striking you all
I am Death - there's no escape
I am Death - the Final One

Rich and poor equal at last
Young and old in death unite
The final age without an end
A timeless void so cold and dark
Bellum - The finest of human arts
Fames - Our tragic curse
Lues - Medicine against us
Letum - Our final reward

War
Some survived this madness and
Starved
But still some survived to get
Plague
This ended the mankind and
Death
Now dominates all
