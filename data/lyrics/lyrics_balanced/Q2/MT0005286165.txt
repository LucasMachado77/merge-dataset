You've crossed the line
You're running in circles, now you've lost all self-control
You medicate
So you can fall asleep, your mind just won't shut down

I wonder where you are
I wonder if you've found your other self
Or are you still somebody else?
There's so much bottled up inside
And it's been shaken up, it's going to explode
You can't stop it, you just can't stop it

You say you're done
You swear you've gave it up
Running in circles you don't
Even care that you're going nowhere
You hate yourself

You've crossed the line
You're running in circles, now you've lost all self-control

I still wonder where you are
I wonder if the thorn's still in your side
Will you pull it out in time?
And now it starts to overflow
And spill its guts and ruins someone's soul
You can't stop it, you just can't stop it

You say you're done
You swear you've gave it up
Running in circles you don't
Even care that you're going nowhere
You hate yourself

You've crossed the line
You're running in circles, now you've lost all self-control
You medicate
So you can fall asleep, your mind just won't shut down

Let's go

You've crossed the line
You're running in circles, now you've lost all self control

You say you're done
You swear you've gave it up
Running in circles you don't
Even care that you're going nowhere
You hate yourself

You're my disaster
I can't stop chasing you
You're my disaster
I can't stop chasing you
