Lying all alone
Wishing you would call
Writing all my thoughts
Has broken all my bones
You gave it all up
You threw it all away
There's nothing I can do
What do I think you've done?
You know it's even
Worse than what's in
My head
You don't believe me
When I tell you:
I don't want to be a fraud
And pretend that everything's fine
I won't be here when you get home
I'm not going to sit here and die

I'll follow through again this time
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride
I'll be just fine

You read me like a book
You know I'm running
Out of legs to
Stand on
I won't believe you
When you tell me
These old habits die so hard
There's no intervention in sight
There's no point in calling you
We're just going to stand here and fight
I'll follow through again this time
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride
I'll be just fine

You fill my head with endless lies
You're killing me, I'm killing time
I'll be just fine

So maybe one day
The pain will go away
And I will see your face
I won't even care
I'm changing all the locks
Cause I can't change you

I'll follow through again this time
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride
I'll be just fine

You fill my head with endless lies
You're killing me, I'm killing time
I'll be just fine
I'll follow through again this time
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride
I'll be just fine

You fill my head with endless lies
You're killing me, I'm killing time
I'll be just fine
