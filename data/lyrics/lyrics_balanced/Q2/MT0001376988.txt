I saw the lights over Baghdad
They called it some kind of storm on my TV
I never saw a storm that looked like that in the sky
Looked more like cowards dropping bombs to me

They never showed you all the suffering there
Tens of thousands children and their mothers mutilated there

About this time there was a noise being heard
Folks from Oklahoma cheering for the absurd
This kind of hate will go full circle some day
They can't believe they lost the Civil War down there anyway!
They put their babies in the gravest kind of danger there
Stupidity results in grief almost everywhere

Sometimes my rage can start to get real old
But revenge is so much sweeter on a plate served cold
Let me make this clear:
They killed beloved friends of mine
Sometimes the ends justify the means
You know that hatred is a two-way street
Your sons and daughters butchered beloved friends of mine

Now, what about this Oklahoma bombing?
People down there think they should be exempt from this kind of thing
Were they not cheering when their boys butchered human beings?
Did not the DEA declare war on my Methadrine?
Jailing families trying to make a dime down in Columbia
My friend, the dealer, life sentence, how can that make sense to ya?
Though I walk through the valley of death
How I prayed for my very last breath
The man who placed that bomb
Is a beloved friend of mine

Sometimes the end justifies the means
Your phony grieving doesn't mean a thing
The day your babies were mangled to bits
Is a holiday of mine

These colors don't run, it has often been said
They put a day care center in a Fed building instead
What kind of coward keeps a hostage like that?
The DEA rolls out the welcome mat

It reminds me of the movies I've seen
Where the scumbag grabs the hostage
I think you know what I mean

Sometimes my rage can start to get real old
But revenge is so much sweeter on a plate served cold
Let me make this clear:
They killed beloved friends of mine
Sometimes the ends justify the means
You know that hatred is a two-way street
Your sons and daughters have killed beloved friends of mine
Though I walk through the valley of death
How I prayed for my very last breath
Your god is but a wretched son of mine
Sometimes the end justifies the means
Your phony grieving doesn't mean a thing
The day your babies were mangled to bits
Is a holiday of mine
Rejoice
I said...
Rejoice!
