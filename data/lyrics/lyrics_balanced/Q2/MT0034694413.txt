You live for tomorrow but you're dying today
You pay your dues but who do you pay
When right is wrong and wrong is right
And there's no more day, you're living in night

It's a new world you better learn to die
It's a new world you better learn to starve
It's a new world you better learn to kill
It's a new world
And you're at war

A new world where movie stars govern
And all the mutants fry in ovens
I turn on the TV and watch people die
And the poor little children don't know how to cry

It's a new world you better learn to die
It's a new world you better learn to starve
It's a new world you better learn to kill
It's a new world
And you're at war
You're at war

Aah!

A new world where movie stars govern
And all the mutants fry in ovens
I turn on the TV and watch people die
And the poor little children don't know how to cry
It's a new world you better learn to die
It's a new world you better learn to starve
It's a new world you better learn to kill
It's a new world
And you're at war

You're at war

It's a new world you better learn to die
It's a new world you better learn to starve
It's a new world you better learn to kill
It's a new world you better learn to die
