The sympathy in my mind is growing cold
Life is like the burning sand, so I'm told
The time is coming near when solitude appears
Take the chains of oppression away

Through the sands of time I'm marching on
The blistering rays of hate strengthen me
The violent mass has shown my destiny
Does all of this justify the rage inside?

The desert rain is changing me
It's calling me to rise
The desert rain is changing me
It's calling me to rise

A world of hate and malice
Yeah, that's the way it seems
The hourglass is running out
The serpent rides with me

We shall rise and conquer
Crushing all that's weak
All that's light is burning out
The serpent rides with me
The serpent rides with me
The desert rain is changing me
It's calling me to rise
The desert rain is changing me
It's calling me to rise
The desert rain is changing me
It's calling me to rise
The desert rain is changing me
It's calling me to rise

The desert rain is changing me
It's calling me
