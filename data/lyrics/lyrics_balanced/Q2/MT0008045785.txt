Rape my soul
Sometimes the truth can be too hard to swallow
Rape my soul
Sometimes the truth can be too hard

Broke out from the chains of stain
Losin' all control
Being hung from my veins
Look into my face
Tell me what you see
A man who's made mistakes or a human disgrace
Emotionally bankrupt and physically corrupt
Weight upon my head is like a ten ton dump truck
Public humiliations, mental assassination
Losin all control of my mental life sensation
Rape my soul
Sometimes the truth can be too hard to swallow
Rape my soul
Sometimes the truth can be too hard

Hey no fuck that I'm being mobbed by the pressure of the rat race
Rather spit on my face than speak my mind put behind by appression
Only microphone can aleve me from the stress
Fear it, dont want to hear it transmit the lyric
To take you inside and make you fuse to your spirit
Hopefully you can see that you can rise above
If you can't you's a buster and you get no love, cuz!

Rape my soul
Sometimes the truth can be too hard to swallow
Rape my soul
Sometimes the truth can be too hard

This is how it sounds, sounds
This is how it sounds, when it all breaks down

Decompression try absorb my life lesson
Try rip the system that keeps my head stessing
Getting frantic from transatlantic
To Trans Euro I express Buddha blessed
Transcend the stress of all that other shit
Fuck the government, heed the profit
This is how it all goes down so watch me drop this kid
This is how you fuckin' give me thanks
My fingers on the trigger hollow tip point blank
This is how it sounds, sounds
This is how it sounds, when it all breaks down

All let masses who can hear me
Know that with no hope and Babylon
Force feeding information down your throat
I close my eyes and clench my fist
Because it's hard to cope when walking down the path of good is like tight rope

This is how it sounds, sounds
This is how it sounds, when it all breaks down

When it all goes down, when it all breaks down
When it all goes down...
