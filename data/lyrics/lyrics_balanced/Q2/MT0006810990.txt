I see them everyday, strangers in a way
But I know them all the same
You can't see them in the light
They're obscured from your sight
It's not a matter of wrong or right

They think there's nothing to fight for
That there is no cause
Just live a life of pleasure
Without any rules or laws
Now more than ever
Is the time to open your eyes
Don't turn your head away
Got to keep questioning why

Care, you've got to care
Search for a way
To live more than a day
Care, no one seems to care
Lives are filled with hate
They resign themselves to fate

Talk about nuclear bombs
And all the other wrongs
Make the world a desperate place
For any kind of race
Another holocaust
How can you measure the cost
With no experience
How can you feel the loss
You all live in apathy
The war won't come to your country
But what gives anyone the right
To keep the world in such a fright
I see them everyday
Strangers in a way
But I know them all the same

Care, you've got to care
Search for a way to live more than a day
Care, no one seems to care
Lives are filled with hate
They resign themselves to fate
Care, you can't despair
The madness causing fear
Is all that you hear
Care, you've got to care
It's a responsibility for you and for me
