Angel hair
Floating over there

Well, you think I don't see
I see clear through

I see little fishes in my sea
Little sea
All the birds turn to hawks in me
Living vicariously
You are 3, haha

Stick your sickness inside my line up
And take your orders
Well done says the one and only
You've left them all behind, lonely
Begging for more floor hours of
You take your punishment well
Swallow it, just steal
Stinking up from behind
And show me the way to the white

Shut!
Wide eyes, wide legs
Shut!
Shut

So you see, little sea
Try to get me
You think I don't see
I see clear through!
Sickness line up
Intake orders well line up

You think I don't see
I see clear through
Ha

Yeah

Yeah, falling, oh
Oh
Oh
Falling, oh
