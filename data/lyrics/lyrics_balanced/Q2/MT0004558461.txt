I intercepted the call to my trigger finger
I resisted every violent impulse I felt towards you
And I can't remember the time or place
When I first got a glimpse of your repulsive face
But the eye wasn't seeing too good and you know it's true

I'm gonna fold my hand
My heart is on the mend
I thought I'd never stop loving you
'Til the very end

Just like the book we read

I waited for you inside the judge's chambers
But you must've had something more important to do
I waited for you outside at the execution
Too bad it wasn't any worse than the times I spent next to you

I'm gonna fold my hand
My heart is on the mend
I thought I'd never stop loving you
'Til the very end

I can't believe those things you said

Broken families, broken children everywhere
Sealed off emotions and unexpressed despair
Can't see they're living in an artificial world
No reference point to recognize something so real
Dysfunction neutralizes all this love I feel
I can't believe I found another artificial girl

God I feel so bad I have never really trusted a female
The indignation that follows, just a phony slut cover-up
This circle of love has been mangled beyond recognition
Take pity on a dog with fleas, it's gonna turn and bite

I'm gonna fold my hand
My heart is on the mend
I think I finally stopped loving you
And that'll be the end

I fantasize that you are dead

Short hair and garish earrings and jewelry through your nose
No one but you will ever care about your clothes
Don't ever look beyond your artificial world

Externally your soul is validated
The sounds you listen to are overrated
I can't believe my heart beat for an artificial girl
