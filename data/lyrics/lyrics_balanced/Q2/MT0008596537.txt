Yeah, I play - 'til my head starts to spin
I play - with your pathetic teared chin
and I play - today you'll be sorry
Yeah, I play - 'cause the devil rocks my body
Played so hard - now it's time for you to go
just one way - that's all you'll know
See me dance - after all I'll stay
and see you die - after all I've played
Yeah, you cry - no mourning comes from me
You cry - and scream endlessly
I play - 'til your goodness turns to sin
I play - 'cause I'm evil from within

Played so hard - now it's time for you to go
just one way - that's all you'll know
See me dance - after all I'll stay
and see you die - after all I've played
