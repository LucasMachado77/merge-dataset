They say that life goes on
But not without a catch
She still don't know how she
Got in this mess
Where was religion
To help her out
Thought it would seal her fate
Without a shadow of a doubt

Just when you think you got it all figured out
You got a deadstop in your life
Never thought it could happen to you
Another deadstop serves you right

He had his hopes set high
But nothing lasts forever
We watched it all
As it just severed
It was his stubborn fault
It was all we could stand
He let it all slip through
The palms of his hands
Just when you think you got it all figured out
You got a deadstop in your life
Never thought it could happen to you
Another deadstop serves you right
