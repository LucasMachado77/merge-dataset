She left me behind
Now things aren't the same
Calling on the telephone
Screaming out my name
And now she's lonely

Told me it was over
We said our last goodbyes
Two weeks later
She's calling everynight
And now she's lonely

Gave her a second chance
And heard the same complaints
Should have known better
Somethings never change

Somethings never change
Somethings never change
Bitch, Nag, Complain
She's on the rag
She picked me up
And let me down
And left me in
The lost and found
And now she's lonely

Kicked through my window
She broke down my door
She's nothing but
A slimey two bit whore
And now she's lonely

I gave her another chance
But heard the same complaints
I should have known the second time
That somethings never change

Somethings never change
Somethings never change
Bitch, Nag, Complain
She's on the rag
