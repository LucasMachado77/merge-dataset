Young, gifted and skint - that's where it in't
Look how easily it happened, look how easily I fell
Now I'm up to here in debt, there's a noose around my neck
There's a price upon my head
My past was all in borrowed time, stupid, stupid borrowed time
Now that the deed is done I'm waiting for the axe to fall
Fantasies grow in my brain - run away and start again
Disappear and change my name
Money makes the world go round, fear makes it turn much faster
Can't pay the rent-man a single thing, don't let the man from the Gas Board in
Maybe this is all a dream, maybe I'll wake up again
Maybe this could all be clean again . .
