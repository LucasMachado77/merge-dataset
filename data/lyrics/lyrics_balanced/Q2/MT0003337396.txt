Inflicting pain is our way of living
Total hate and no forgiving
Always pushed down by someone stronger
Cannot take it any longer

Now it's time to fight back - to fight back
Break the painful chains that have been around our necks
Now it's time to fight back - to fight back
Unlock the fucking doors have held us all locked up

The weak forced down by the ones with power
This might be your final hour
Force yourself to break free
If you fight back they will see

Now it's time to fight back - to fight back
Break the painful chains that have been around our necks
Now it's time to fight back - to fight back
Unlock the fucking doors have held us all locked up

We have been forced down for far too long
But now it's time for us to be strong
So join the crew, it's time to see
And face the fact - we must fight bac
