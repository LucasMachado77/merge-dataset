Slide over here
Over where i can see your face
Slide over here
Over where i can find a trace

Wind in my hair
Makes me feel like i'm going somewhere
Wind in my hair
On my back heralds secret attacks

Dark comes again
Just 'round the bend
Covers your head
And it's real
Of all thngs to say
I'm on my way
Shake you all day
Flies on the wall
Rocks will fall down to block my way
Flies on the wall
Rocks will fall down to cancel my stay
