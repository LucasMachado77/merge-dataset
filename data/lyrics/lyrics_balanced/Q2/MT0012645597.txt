Her name was Jane, she lived alone
She had to go out, out to the phone
She had to cross the moor that night
She was all alone, and out of site

There was a flash of steel
And a lot of blood
She could not scream
He had cut her throat
He tore her body, limb from limb
He liked to kill, he loved to sin

Her name was Jane, she lived alone
She had to go out, out to the phone
She had to cross the moor that night
She was all alone, and out of site
I saw the girl, the one who's dead
I saw her walking, without her head
She walked before me, before my eyes
I saw the blood, I heard her cries
She got decapitated
Now I remember, it's coming clear
I had the axe, she had the fear
She had the body, I had the lust
She didn't want me, so die she must
