They try to keep you scared and small
Telling you the world ain't safe at all
Gotta smash the smokescreen
Dont swallow the lies they feed
They wage a war thats based on greed
Dont believe your t.v
Gotta know your enemy

Were the kids were quit aware
Of the rotten smell thats in the air
The power games have got to stop
Times up
Times up
Times up now

People die people loose their hope
Cheated by the man who cut the rope
Watch the world fall down - down down
I guess, it must be nice up there
But did you really think no one cares?
Gotta step down - right now
Times up - we can't take any more
No more
Were the kids were quit aware
Of the rotten smell thats in the air
The power games have got to stop
Times up
Times up
Times up
Were the kids and were well aware
And we ain't gunna sit around and stare
A facts a fact enoughs enoughs
Times up
Times up

Step down
Right now
Step down
Right now
Step down
Tight now
STEP DOWN!!
Times up
TIMES UP

Were the kids were quit aware
Of the rotten smell thats in the air
The power games have got to stop
Times up
Times up
Times up
Were the kids and were well aware
And we ain't gunna sit around and stare
A facts a fact enoughs enoughs
Times up
Times up
Times up
Time time ohohoh
Time time ohohoh
Time time ohohoh
Time time ohohoh
