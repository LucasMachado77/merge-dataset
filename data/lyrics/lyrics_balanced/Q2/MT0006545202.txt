This time I'm on the edge
The edge of my ability
Something crawls within me
Give me an answer what to do

There must be someone
Does anyone care?
Resistance is futile

I'm beoming a machine of the future
One leader - one goal
Hooked to cables and hose
Programmed with instructions to kill
Hydraulic blood and synthetic eyes

If assignment goes as planned
An upgrade will be done
The files say
Armed with electricity
You know when I'm around
The glitches will tell
I don't show up alone

No minds - just the will to kill
No regrets bathe in blood that's spilled
One mind - taking care of the plan
One voice - telling us which are to be scanned

Exterminating every humand life
Taking control of space and time
Pray for death - it will come soon
We breathe no air - advance is mine

I'm becoming a machine of the future
One leader - one goal
Hooked to cables and hose
Programmed with instructions to kill
Hydraulic blood and syntethic eyes

We will just be one
One kind, one machine
One leader, one goal
We will grow the flourish
Become the intelligent race
Control every boundry
Infiltrate your world
Soon we will have your mind
No minds - just the will to kill
No regrets - bathe in blood that's spilled
