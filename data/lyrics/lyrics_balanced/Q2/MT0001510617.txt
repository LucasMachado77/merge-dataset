You say you feel close to death
It seems like nothing is left
You think the end is near
That's why we're here

Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear

Can't wait till friday night
It's time to fuck or fight
We'll get a gut full of suds
We'll go hammer some cruds

Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
Cold ones on my mind
Oceans of buds it's a crime
So much beer so little time

We get right friday nigh
It's time to fuck or fight
We'll get a gut full of suds
And slam into some sluts

Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
Have a beer with fear
