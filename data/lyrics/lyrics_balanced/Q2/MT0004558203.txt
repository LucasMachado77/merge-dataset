Baby, you got me all wrong
And maybe I'm not at all down and out
Well I'm high and I'm in
Don't you know who I am
I'm the jaded one with pop insensitivity
And when I finish struggling
We can make our way to the dance floor
And stand like strangers in an elevator
Stuck between stories
I always find myself
In the middle of your stories
With the camera as a witness I will suffer
With the camera as a witness I will suffer
If everything I do is wrong
Then by God I do it right

If everything I do is wrong
Then by God I do it right

If everything I do is wrong
Then by God I do it right

If everything I do is wrong
Then by God I do it right

We don't dance no, no, no
We got class
No we don't have any fun at all
It's a new style and we know it
We're not stunning, we're just stunned

We're lying for a living
We're lying for a living

Don't you know who I am
I'm the real thing with low-key sensibilities
I don't need what I've got
Half as much as everyone covets it
Well, if loving me is wrong
Then God damn you do it right
Well, if loving me is wrong
Then God damn you do it right
It turns us on, to turn you down
We're turned on, to turn you down
