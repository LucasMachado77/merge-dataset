No people, no trucks, no cars
No movies, no TV stars
Humanity is erased
Black forest left in its place

No burgers, no sports, no jokes
Civilization was a hoax
Fire smoldering, ash and death
Black forest, the after-breath

No churches, no garbage cans
No punk, no garage bands
No organism left to grow
Black forest and fallout snow

Black forest
Black forest
Black forest
Black forest

Black forest
Black forest
Black forest
Black forest

Black forest
Black forest
Black forest
Black forest
