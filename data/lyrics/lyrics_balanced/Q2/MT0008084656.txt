Clear your mind
Hide your fear
Don't look around
Don't turn around
Pennywise is here

Hold your feelings
Hide your fear
Don't look around
Don't turn around
Pennywise is here

Evil lurks in his eyes
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by suprise
The clown they call Pennywise

He's a monster
He's not human
He's more than just a figment of your imagination
You can't run can't hide
There's no way to escape Pennywise

Evil lurks in his eyes
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by suprise
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll creep inside your soul at night
And torment nice and slow
Don't turn around or look around
Pennywise will know
He'll make you wish that you were dead
And make it hard to cope
He'll make you wish that you were dead
And hanging by a rope

Evil lurks in his eyes
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by suprise
The clown they call Pennywise

Clear your mind
Hide your fear
Don't look around
Don't turn around
Pennywise is here
