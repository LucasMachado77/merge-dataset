I was awake I overheard your speech
My ego dried and sank
Talked with your ex and we agreed
Thought of your sister helped us wank
I'm sure you know that I have fancied her since she began high school
But back in then, and I will promise I will let your engine cool

I have matured, I've come of age, my vision's clear
But there's still some things that I don't want to hear
And I know that it was probably just those Es, but be a bit more thoughtful next time, please

While I'm alive, well, I just drive
Each time I scored I just got bored
And that's no bollocks... I am just a slut
