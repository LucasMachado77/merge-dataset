You buried it so deep
So safe in hidden sleep
But like a tell-tale corpse
Rises to the surface
Over-ripe and bloated
In naked time-lapsed truth
Thought it was lost forever
Remember this

How long has it been
Or have you forgotten
When you first forgot?
Now resurrection the phoenix
Aflame with pride and conceit
Remembers this

Wind blown trees outside
Applauding like the ocean
To the cacophony inside
The waves come rushing in
A crashing whispering
Drowning they drink me

Ah not forgotten
This is not forgotten
Remember this
