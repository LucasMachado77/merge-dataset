Since you've been gone
I drink and gamble every night
Girl, I drink and gamble every night
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just won't do right

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Am I the one?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Am I the one?
Tell me, tell me, am I the one?

Since you've been gone
I've been all alone
Waiting and watching for you, oh
My heart is crying, slowly I'm dying
Still I'm feeling for you
(Still, still, still you, baby)

Oh, I drink and gamble every night
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just won't do right
Too-dup, woo-ooh, why
