I'm falling off the barstool mama, in this old ghost town saloon
Where sunlight moves like sadness across the room
Oh my, sweet mama, if you could only see me now
Drunk as a skunk falling out of this rundown lacy gown

This blue ink
This blue ink
This blue ink across the page
I write to you

I'm sitting in these thorny cowboy boots and scabby knees
Wondering why I left you mama, just to do as I please
No hat has a brim wide enough to block out the blazing sun
I met the devil on the road but I had no legs to run

This blue ink
This blue ink
This blue ink across the page
I write to you
Silver ran off two towns ago
I been walking alone, I been walking slow
My eyes are dry from the desert wind
I know I ain't coming home to you again

I'll take off into the deep blue sky
When I'm dead and gone and the buzzards fly
This blue ink across the page I write to you
Mama, if you love me, you're the only one who do
