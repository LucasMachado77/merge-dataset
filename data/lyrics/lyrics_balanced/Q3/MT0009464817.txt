The wind don't care
Which way it's blowing
So where are you going
Time to give up
Time to give up knowing
Your shoes don't care
Which way they're going
So who are you following
Time to give up
Time to give up tiredness

So many things I don't understand
But there's one thing I know
When everything is a rope of sand
We should be learning to let it go
Don't wanna win
Don't wanna lose
So where does that lead you
Trying to give up
Trying to give up trying
The games don't care
If you see right through them
So who are you fooling
Time to give up
Time to give up playing now

So many things I don't understand
But there's one thing I know
When everything is a rope of sand
We should be learning to let it go

What happens when you let it go
Does it cause a crumbling fold?
Slowly realizing you can love
Without having to hold

So many things I don't understand
But there's one thing I know
When everything is a rope of sand
We should be learning to let it go
