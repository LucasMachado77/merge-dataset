They say my voice is so appealing,
That no-one sings the blues the way I do,
But little do they know,
Their praise just hoes to show
Every word I sing rings true.

Each night in some caf√© I'm on display
Until the dark turns into dawn.
Up upon the stand,
Singing with the band
While the music plays on.

Each night is just a long
And endless song
Until the last couple has gone.
Vainly I must start
Singing out my heart
While the music plays on

Oh, what madness to discover
Music still possesses all its charms,
As I serenade my lover
Dancing by in someone else's arms.

But I am not allowed
To show the crowd
What happens when romance has gone.
I must hid my fears,
Singing through the tears
While the music plays on.

Oh, what madness to discover

Dancing by in someone else's arms.

Singing through the tears
While the music plays on
