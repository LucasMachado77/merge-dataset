You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I know I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

It's too sad
It's too bad
But I'm in love with you
You love me
Then you snub me
Oh, what can I do?
I'm still in love you
I guess I'll never see the light
I'll get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you

I guess I'll never see the light
I'll get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you
