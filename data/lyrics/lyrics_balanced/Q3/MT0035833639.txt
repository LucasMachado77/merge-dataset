Woke up cryin' with pictures of you in my head
Lyin' next to the thing that you don't know I did
I could tell on myself but I don't think that I have the nerve
If I lose you I know that it's what I deserve

In a way I'm glad that my guilt keeps
Fallin' on me like rain
At the same time I can't help but wonderin' why
I put your love on the line

I could stop but the truth is I don't think I can
It's not something I wanted, it's something I planned
Boy, I love you, I need you, I want you to stay
I keep my secrets to keep you from walking away

In a way I'm glad that my guilt keeps
Fallin' on me like rain
At the same time I can't help but wonderin' why
I put your love on the line
In a way I'm glad that my guilt keeps
Fallin' on me like rain
At the same time I can't help but wonderin' why
I put your love on the line

Put your love on the line
Put your love on the
Put your love on the line
