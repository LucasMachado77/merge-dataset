Came down on a Monday
Somewhere in the Midlands
Tasted man, tasted flea
Couldn't tell the difference
Asked around on Tuesday
Got nothing from a tree
The guide had said, "What talks is red"
That's all there is to see

Who wants the world?
Who wants the world?
Who wants the world?
Not me
(Please allow me to re-)
Not me
(Arrange your face some)
Not me
(Times, I'd really)
Not me
(Like to get to know you better)

Looked around on Wednesday
Took in all the sights
The Promised Land they'd left to man
Been ruined overnight
Peering through the portholes
With teardrops in their eyes
The ship they took for one last look
At Thursday's setting sunrise
