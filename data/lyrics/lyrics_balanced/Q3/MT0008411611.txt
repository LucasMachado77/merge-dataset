Trying to make up all their lost time
From Buffalo to Washington

You can wash my jumper, starch my overalls
Catch a train they call the Cannonball
From Buffalo to Washington

My baby's left me, she even took my shoes
Enough to give a man these doggone worried blues
She's gone, she's solid gone

Yonder comes the train, coming down the track
Carry me away but it ain't gonna carry me back
My honey, babe, my blue eyed babe

I'm going up north, I'm going up north this fall
If luck don't change, I won't be back at all
My honey, babe, I'm leaving you

Trying to make up all their lost time
From Buffalo to Washington
