Mmmm, omm

If my mother had not died
Lord my father left his child at home
If my mother had not died
Lord my father left his child at home
Maybe my life wouldn't be so miserable, baby
Lord and I wouldn't be so all alone

I was born in Alabama
Lord and I was raised up in Tennessee
I was born in Alabama
Lord and I was raised up in Tennessee
But no matter where I travel
Somebody always have tried to hurt for me

Well, I rather been lying dead
Sleeping way down in my grave
Lord and live long in this sarrow
Hell and misery everyday
