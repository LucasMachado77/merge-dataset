She swears there's nothin' wrong, but somethin's missin'
She's never been much good at tellin' lies
'Cause you can hear the sounds of leavin', if you listen
This may be California, but Oklahoma's in her eyes

And I've got a good thing goin'
It's plain to see she's tired of hangin' on
Yes, I've got a good thing goin'
And it's killin' me that she's as good as gone

By now she must be tired of always givin'
And tired of what she's gettin' in return
I guess Oklahoma's more her style of livin'
'Cause I can see her heart is headin' across a bridge I thought she'd burned

And I've got a good thing goin'
It's plain to see she's tired of hangin' on
Yes, I've got a good thing goin'
And it's killin' me that she's as good as gone

Lord, it's killin' me that she's as good as gone
