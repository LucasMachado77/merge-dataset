I was in amber
Did you see me when I melted down?
Did you see me when I stuck to the ground?
Will you love me when I get out?

I was concreted
Did you see my head stick out the ground?
Did you like me as a statue?
Will you love me when I break out?

I was all frozen
Did you see me as the snow man?
Did you like me at the pop cycle stand?
Will you love me when I thaw out?

I was held back now
Did you see the rope I tied around?
Did you like me when I was spell bound?
Will you love me when I break out?
