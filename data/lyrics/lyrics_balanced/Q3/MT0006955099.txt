I've been to all the ol' familiar places
At least a hundred times
Since you've been gone
I've seen a lot of ol' familiar faces
But again tonight I'm goin' home alone

My heart won't let me love no one but you
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new
But my heart won't let me love no one but you

I've told myself a million times, it's over
You've gotta face the truth and let her go
Just when I think I've got it all together
Your memory walks around inside my soul
