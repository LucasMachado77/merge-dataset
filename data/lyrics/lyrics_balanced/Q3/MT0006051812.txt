She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
No matter where I go, no matter who I see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me

Though she said goodbye and set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me

I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me, she was true, true, true
Should have done right when I had my day
Now I'm all alone and I'm havin' to pay

She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Guess I had it comin' 'cause she set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me

I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me, she was true, true, true
Should have done right when I had my day
Now I'm all alone and I'm havin' to pay

She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Guess I had it comin' 'cause she set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me

She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Oh, the sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
