I watched them fall together
Then I watched me fall apart
At first I couldn't believe my mind
But I've gotta believe my heart
I can't help but think of us
Every time I think of them
It's all over town
She's over me
She's all over him

It's all over town
She's all over him
And she's over me
It hurts to know just how it is
Cause I know how it used to be
I used to be the one who held her
Alot of things have changed since then
It's all over town
She's over me
She's all over him

A million liquid memories
Flood the rivers of my soul

My heart reached it's breaking point
A long long time ago
I watched them melt in the shadows
As I watched the lights grow dim
It's all over town
She's over me
And she's all over him

It's all over town
She's all over him
And she's over me
It hurts to know just how it is
Cause I know how it used to be
I used to be the one who held her
Alot of things have changed since then
It's all over town
She's over me
She's all over him

It's all over town
She's over me
And she's all over him
