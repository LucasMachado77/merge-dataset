The dark brown shades of my skin
Only add colour to my tears
That splash against my hollow bones, that rocks my soul
Looking back over my false dreams, that I once knew
Wondering why my dreams never came true
Somebody tell me, what can I do

Something is holding me back
Is it because I'm black?

In this world of no pity
I was raised in the ghetto of the city
Momma, she works so hard
To earn every penny

Something is holding me back
Is it because I'm black?
Something is holding me back
I wonder, Is it because I'm black?

Like a child stealing candy for the first time, and got caught
Around life's corner somewhere I got lost
Something is holding me back
Is it because I'm black?
Something is holding me back
Is it because I'm black?
And be somebody, somehow, and someway
