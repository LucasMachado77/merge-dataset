When whippoorwill are calling
Night is gently falling
That when I miss you most
When I'm feeling lonely
Thinking of you only
That's when I miss you most

I'm deep in meditation
Searchin all creation
For the one that's so divine
I'll miss you when its day light
I'll miss you when its midnight
Gosh I miss you all the time

When church bells are ringing
Nightingales are singing
Thats when I'll miss you most
When I'm feeling lonely
Thinking of you only
Thats when I'll miss you most

When old friends get together
In any kind of weather
I feel like I'm left behind
I miss your arms a stealing
Around me so appearling
Gosh, I miss you all the time
