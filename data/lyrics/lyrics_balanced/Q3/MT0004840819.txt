After hundreds of lies and fake alibis
After too many times staying out all night
After too many women, too

Many times of acting free
After all this time of cheating
I've been cheatin' me

Yes, I cheated me right out of you
By holding the wrong ones, I had to lose
I lost out at my own game 'cause look who cheated who
I cheated me right out of you

Now, I'm here alone 'cause I was all wrong
Too many times I've two timed
And this time you're gone

I gambled that you'd never walk out and leave
I cheated you
Now, I'm cheating me

Yes, I cheated me right out of you
By holding the wrong ones, I had to lose
I lost at my own game 'cause look who cheated who
I cheated me right out of you, I cheated me right out of you
