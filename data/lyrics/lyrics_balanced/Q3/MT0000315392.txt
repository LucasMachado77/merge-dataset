Love is never obbligato
Love is always improvised
Ultra blue, I was always unhappy
A lark without a song
Never knew I could be happy
Until you came along

Cut to a love scene in some fantasy
When you smiled at me
Dancers in a dream, perfect harmony
When you smiled at me

I saw the lightning, heard the crash
Of thunder
When you smiled at me
I knew I must have finally hit the number
When you smiled at me

I was always strangely solo
Funny how you knew my key
When I met you it suddenly banished
The loneliness I feared
All my bad luck and misery vanished
The moment you appeared

Cut to a love scene in some fantasy
When you smiled at me
Dancers in a dream, perfect harmony
When you smiled at me
I saw the lightning, heard the crash
Of thunder
When you smiled at me
I knew I must have finally hit the number
When you smiled at me
