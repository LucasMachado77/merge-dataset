You said it yourself - you can't help but flirt and I'd be the first to admit that I'm easily hurt
I can't take things lightly - you said I'm always in a huff
I know it was just the once but what if that's enough?

Just shut the f**k up and tell me bit by bit, 'cause all I can see is his hand grabbing a tit
I do one four seven one the minute I get in and if your number's not there your stuff stays in the bin
