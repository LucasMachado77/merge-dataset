If I give my love to you
You tell me that you will, did you?
If I give my love to you
You tell me that you will, did you?

Gal, if you don't be nowhere right
Please, don't you rate my love

I tried to talk to you
You would not listen to me me
I tried to talk to you
You would at least tell me

Don't bat me or bruise me
Go ahead and leave me be

You should make up in your mind
Then you will know what to do
You should make up your mind
Then you will know what to do

Girl, if you play me for a fool
My shotgun will shoot dead at you

If I give my love to you
Will you give me everything you said?
If I give my love to you
Will you give me everything you said?

I'd go down and down for you
If you promise me that you'll be true
