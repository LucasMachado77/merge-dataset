Sittin' in a restaurant she walked by
I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I said "who's that?" You said with a smile
"Oh it's nobody, oh nobody"

Maybe that explains the last two week
You called me up, dead on your feet
Working late again, I ask who with
You said "nobody, oh nobody."

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever?
(Clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Late last night we went for a drive
You were miles away I asked "who's on your mind?"
You said, "Nobody, nobody. Why do you ask?"
Oh, her again I could have told you that.

We came back home got ready for bed
I said to myself I've got one shot left
Your still mine and I won't stand in line
Behind nobody, nobody!

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever?
(Clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better.
