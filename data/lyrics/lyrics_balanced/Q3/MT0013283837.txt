The streets're dark and empty and you walk them all alone
You think about your love affair and wonder what went wrong
You go to bed each night and pray you'll never see the dawn
Afraid of each tomorrow with its heartless cold unknown

And that's what it's like to be lonesome with a heart a broken love taught to cry
And that's what it's like to be lonesome I know 'cause I'm a mighty lonesome guy

You search to find a tavern where the music is playing loud
You try to lose your heartaches in the laughter of the crowd
But the happy couples make you think of things that might have been
And you have to fight the teardrops till you're by yourself again

And that's what it's like to be lonesome with a heart a broken love taught to cry
And that's what it's like to be lonesome I know 'cause I'm a mighty lonesome guy
