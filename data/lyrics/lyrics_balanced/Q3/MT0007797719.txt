When you find your sweetheart in the arms of a friend
That's when your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime must come to an end
That's when your heartaches begin

Love is a thing you never can share
When you bring a friend into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend
That's when your heartaches begin

When you find your sweetheart
In the arms of your best friend, brother
That's when all your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime
Must all come to an end
That's when your heartaches begin
You see ,love is a thing
That you never can share
And when you bring a friend
Into your love affair
That's the end
That's the end of your sweetheart
Jack, I'm tellin' ya, that's the end of your friend

That's when your heartaches begin
