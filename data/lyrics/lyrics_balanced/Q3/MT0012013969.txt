f I see someone hold her tight that's all right they're just dancing
If they're together in the moonlight they're just talking not romancing
If I see her out with someone it's just some old friend from school
That's how it looks through the eyes of a fool.

If her phone rings and she whispers I can talk now I don't care
It don't matter and she'd rather not discuss it with me there
If I see her smile at someone that's not breaking any rule
That's how it looks through the eyes of a fool.

They say that seeing is believeing believe me it's not true
You can teach your eyes to only see the things youe want then to
So I'd rather keep pretending like a little child in school
I'll keep looking through the eyes of a fool.

Yes, I'll keep looking through the eyes of a fool...
