I wish I liked you
As much as I love you
Cause things you do make me cry
But when I say goodbye
Like a fool I come running back home

How many times I left you let's see five
How many times I came back home same number five
My friends say I'm a fool because I still fool with you
And I Keep coming back for more just like a fool would do
I guess I'm just stuck in my foolish ways
I'm going crazy cause I ain't talk to you in days
I love you more than a basketball wife loves to spend cash
But I only like you as much as a fat girl likes gym class
I can't stop coming back like Lindsay Lohan does rehab
Us together is more explosive than a pissed off A-rab
I love you but I don't like you somehow you got a lock on me
I love you and I hate you but I like you when you are on top of me
I love the way you look but I hate the way you talk to me
You look beautiful in that dress I try to touch you you say get off of me
What happened to us we was so happy before
We were suppose to be soul mates now you don't like me no more

I wish I liked you
As much as I love you
Cause things you do make me cry
But when I say goodbye
Like a fool I come running back home

I can't believe you're gone this situation is embarrassing
I never thought I would see the day that our marriage would end
They say I act crazy now since you gone
I'm just crazy in love that's why I made this song
My behavior sometimes I know it might confuse you
I accused you and abused you
That's why I had to lose you
This caught me off guard though cause I didn't see this coming
Damn I really thought I knew how to read you woman
All these years I thought I knew how to treat you woman
I'm too old to be alone I really need you woman
But I can't have you cause we don't like each other
Probably why lately all we do is fight each other
But baby I miss you don't you miss me
This house is cold and lonely without you plus its empty
You will always be my wife even if you lose that label
I don't like you right now but in my heart you still my angel

I wish I liked you
As much as I love you
Cause things you do make me cry
But when I say goodbye
Like a fool I come running back home
