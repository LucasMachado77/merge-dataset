You said you'd be in Alabam'
When I got there, you'd gone with Sam
You took the twelve oh four and left for Baltimore

Why'd you do it baby? Why'd you do it baby?
Why'd you do it baby? Why can't you wait for me

I headed east to Blatimore
But I already knew the scoree
Somebody said you'd gone to Louisville with Bill

Why'd you do it baby? Why'd you do it baby?
Why'd you do it baby? Why can't you wait for me

I followed you to Louisville
And I was feeling good until
I heard that you'd been seen down in New orleans

Why'd you do it baby? Why'd you do it baby?
Why'd you do it baby? Why can't you wait for me

I hitched a ride to New Orleans
Thought it would be my land of dreams
My traveling days are through
I can't find a trace of you

Why'd you do it baby? Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you do it baby? Can't follow you no more
No more
