Tears in my eyes, blue as I can be
Just had another woman walk out on me
But I will keep on trying
I'll find my true true love somewhere
Someone to love me like I love her
And always treat me fair and square

I fell so hard, thought it was real
Played me like a fool, know just how I feel
But I'll keep on trying
With tears out strolling from my eyes
Well I believed her when she told me
She told me such sweet sweet lovely lies
Wish I could laugh, wish I could cry
Got so tired of living, do not wanna die
But I'll keep on trying
No, I'll never be the same
People say the sun is shining
But I'm still walking in the rain

Tears in my eyes, blue as I can be
Just had another woman walk out on me
But I will keep on trying
I'll find my real true love somewhere
Someone to love me like I love her
Always treat me so fair and square

And where your mother's violence
Sent your soul underground
Where tears roll down
Where tears roll down

Got fed on tea and sympathy
Blew the sail like the wind
