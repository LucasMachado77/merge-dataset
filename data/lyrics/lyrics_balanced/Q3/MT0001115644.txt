Your love just came to visit, your memory came to stay
It's a shame that being gone don't mean you went away
For me it won't be over till the day I find
That one of us has gone out of my mind

I'll give up on loving you or else I'll go insane
It really makes no difference as long as there's no pain
I know it's just a matter of misery and time
Till one of us has gone out of my mind

Either I'll forget or I'll go crazy
One way or another I'm gonna leave you behind

I know that I'll be tortured by your memory
Till one of us has gone out of my mind
Till one of us has gone out of my mind...
