My love is artificial
My love is artificial
Your time may come and I won't care

Wake up, it's so official
Wake up, they're coming to meet you
Your time may come and I won't care

GO!

My love is artificial
My love is artificial
Your time may come and I won't care
Wake up, it's so official
Wake up, they're coming to meet you
Your time may come and I won't care

GO!

When I went riding around
When I went going down

My love is artificial
My love is artificial
Your time may come and I won't care

Wake up, it's so official
Wake up, they're coming to meet you
Your time may come and I won't care

GO!
