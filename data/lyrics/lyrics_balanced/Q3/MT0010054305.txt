Should've been much further
Than this by now
Little bit more gone a little
Less twisted around
Shouldv'e been much better
You'd think
But I'm not, I'm still stuck
I'm still here in this rut
Looking back on everything
That we had
Holding on to words that we
Can't take back
What am I to do with the past
When it's all that I have
And I can't get you back

Now I wait by the phone
In the dark, drunk on hope
I'm so lost, I'm so low
And I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
I'm reminded of us
Where we've been, all we've done
And all the love that we shared
Once
Oh, once --

I remember you saying I was the one
And nothing could change that
But you were wrong
Its funny how life turns on a dime
Now we don't even talk
I just stare at these walls

And I wait by the phone
In the dark, drunk on hope
I'm so lost, I'm so low
And I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
I'm reminded of us
Where we've been, all we've done
And all the love that we shared
Once

Once, you made the world feel
So right
Once, you were my morning
Noon and night
Why'd we slip away
Why did it all change
Now will I ever be the same

Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope
Im so lost Im so alone, and I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go Im reminded of us
Where we've been all we've done and all the love that we shared

Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope
Im so lost Im so alone, and I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go Im reminded of us
Where we've been all we've done and all the love that we shared

Should've been much further
Than this by now
Little bit more gone a little less
Twisted around
