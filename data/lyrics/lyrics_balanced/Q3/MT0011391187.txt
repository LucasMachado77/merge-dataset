I've got a cold, cold feelin' it's just like ice around my heart
I've got a cold, cold feelin' it's just like ice around my heart
I know I'm gonna' quit somebody, every time that, feelin' starts

You treat me like a prisoner, because my hands are tied
Everything you do to me, is stackin' up inside

It's a cold, cold feelin' yeah, you're just like ice around my heart
I know I'm gonna' quit somebody, every time that, feelin' starts

There's a change in me baby, once I was blind but now I can see
There's a change in me baby, once I was blind but now I can see
I'm gonna' put everybody down baby
That ever made a fool outta me
