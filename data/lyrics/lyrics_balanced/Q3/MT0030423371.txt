Fills me up inside dropping like a death threat
Well I'm a lover and then a fighter
No easy rider just like my fallen brothers watchin' over me

Hip to the game but the game brought the pain
Starin' at the walls I'm wondering how I'm gonna make it out
Destiny to victory you gotta run before you crawl
You must rise above it

Listen up to our life
All your dreams are misguided, hang on
Holding on to your pride
But it won't give you what you want, hang on

Life will bring you up, life will put you down
Life will build you up and then burn you down
Life will bring you up, life will put you down
Life will build you up just to burn you down

Step inside and testify you're starin' at your death
But you won't stop to catch your motherfucking breath
Petty bangsters playin' up the pranksters
Runnin' from the officer, city executioner

Come alive don't dive into the violent life
So leave the light on 'cause I'll be coming right on up
Quick fast as I dash for the cash
I'm leaving all those other motherfuckers in the past

Listen up to our life
All your dreams are misguided, hang on
Holding on to your pride
But it won't give you what you want, hang on

Life will bring you up, life will put you down
Life will build you up and then burn you down
Life will bring you up, life will put you down
Life will build you up just to burn you down

Help us, help us
Help us, help us
That I may shine
That I may shine

Listen up to your life
All your dreams are misguided, hang on, hang on
Holding on to your pride
But it don't give you what you want

Life will bring you up, life will put you down
Life will build you up just to burn you down
Life will bring you up, life will put you down
Life will build you up just to burn you down

Life will bring you up, life will put you down
Life will build you up just to burn you down

Fills me up inside dropping like a death threat
Well I'm a lover and then a fighter
