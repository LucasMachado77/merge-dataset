I'm lonesome tonight
Ring, telephone, ring
I'm through with pretending
There's no way to forget

I miss her tonight
Ring, telephone, ring
This night has no ending
Dreams of her linger yet

Like a couple of fools
We parted, I vowed
I'd never call
Now, I'd give my all
To have her with me
But where can she be?

I need her tonight
Ring, telephone, ring
If I could but hear her
Oh, what joy it would bring
I'll wait for her, please, please
Ring, telephone, ring

I need her tonight
Ring, telephone, ring
If I could but hear her
Oh, what joy it would bring
I'll wait for her, please, please
Ring, telephone, ring
