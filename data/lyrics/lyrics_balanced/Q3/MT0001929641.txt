Well, I've got a gal who lives upon the hill
Well, I've got a gal who lives upon a hill
Well, the woman tryin' a-quit me but, but baby I love you still

You got eyes like a diamond, shine like Klondike gold
She got eyes like diamond, shine like Klondike gold
Ev'ry time she loves me, she thrills my mellow soul

You so beautiful you got to die someday
Honey, you so beautiful you got to die someday
All I want, a little lovin' just 'fore you pass away

Honey, you so beautiful but you got to die someday
Honey, you so beautiful you got to die someday
Honey, give me little lovin' just 'fore you pass away
