Take it away. Take it away
Take away these feelings cuz they're bringing me down
Cuz I can't breathe. Feels like I can't breathe
Feels just like this whole world's coming down on me

Oh, can I be forgiven for all I have done?

Can you set me free? Can you set me free?
Set me free from all this pain life's done to me

If you can hear me praying, then I'll ask one more time

Can you take it away, Lord? Oh, can I be forgiven?
Can you take it away, Lord? Help me change my ways of living

Oh, can I be forgiven for all I have done?
Is there time for me? Is there still time for me?
Time to change whatever I've got left of me

If you can hear me praying, then I'll ask one more time

Can you take it away, Lord? Oh, can I be forgiven?
Can you take it away, Lord? Help me change my ways of living
