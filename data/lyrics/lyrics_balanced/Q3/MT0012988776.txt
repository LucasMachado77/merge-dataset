There's a devil in my body
That I just can't satisfy
Other women haunt me
Even though I love my wife.

It's because I really love her,
I try to save her heart with lies
But I know she knows
I can see it in her eyes.

I try to stay at home, love only her,
Play with the kids and watch T.V.
But then my mind becomes unsure
About the kind of love I need.

My reasons for cheating
There as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand
And still stand by me?

It's so hard for me to call her
I can hardly dial the phone
I did wrong again last night,
Now I just want to go back home.

She knows that I lied,
Lord, she'll cry where I can't see
How much more can she stand
And still stand by me?

How much more can she stand
And still stand my me?..
