You've been out playing it cool
I've been home playing the fool
Every night you're at the go-go
Every night you're with a new love
While I've been so true love

The boy that I once admired
Only comes by when he's tired
Ever since you joined the in-crowd
You just wanna be a rover
Well this party's over

Baby a go-go
Baby a go-go, go, go
Baby a go-go, go away

Baby a go-go
Baby a go-go, go, go
Oh baby don't cling on
Baby it's much too late, yeah

Someday you'll find you were wrong
You won't be blind for too long
Father time wil change the rhythm 
And you'll wake up with a need-to
To where nobody needs you

Baby a go-go
Baby a go-go, go, go
Baby a go-go, go away

Baby a go-go
Baby a go-go, go, go
Oh baby don't cling on
Baby it's much too late

Baby a go-go
Oh, baby a go-go, go, go
