They were separated one year ago that day
The court had given him their only child
When play time was all finished he climbed on daddy's knee
And said with teardrops showing through a smile

Daddy when is mommy coming home
Each day you say it won't be very long
I always see you cry since mommy said goodbye
And went away and left us all alone

Each night i kneel beside my bed and then
I always pray that she'll come back again
I wonder if she knows that we're so all alone
Daddy when is mommy coming home
