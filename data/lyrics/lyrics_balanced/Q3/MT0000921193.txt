I paid the bank note, the car note, an' yes, I paid the 'phone bill too.
An' then I turned around an' I found that the house note's due.
Well, I'd love to take you out like I said I would, honey,
But there's too much month at the end of the money.

Well, I got a little favour I wanna ask of you, my love,
Why don't you find that hole in my pocket an' sew it up?
Yeah, I thought I'd saved some but, you know, it's funny:
There's too much month at the end of the money.

All gone, oh, heaven only knows.
All gone, oh, where on earth it goes,
But it sure goes.
Well, sometimes I think it blows away.

I went down to the bank this mornin', 'bout half past nine.
Well, I was lookin' for a little somethin' in the credit line.
But the man said: "Look, what we got here, sonny:
"There's too much month at the end of the money."

I'd love to take you out like I said I would, honey,
But there's too much month at the end of the money.
Too much month at the end of the money.
