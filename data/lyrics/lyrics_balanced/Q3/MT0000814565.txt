Blood marks the road
Where the animal left its life behind
In a red stain
That the rain will wash away
Fall of night foretold
Sky colors like a bruise
And i think of ones i used to know and
Of paths they had to choose
For we are born and we remain forever
Trapped inside our heads
No human chords are struck
Without a resonance in other lives
But the echoes we hold onto seem
As arbitrary as the times
For we are born and will remain
