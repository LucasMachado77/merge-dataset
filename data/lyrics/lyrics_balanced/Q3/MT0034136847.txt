Now I would rather be sloppy drunk
A-than anything I know
You know I'd rather be sloppy drunk
A-than anything I know
You know in another half-a-pint
Woman, an you will see me go

Now, my gal she done quit me
For somebody else
Now, my little gal she done quit me
For somebody else
Now, an' I'm sloppy drunk again, woman
Sleepin' all by myself

Now, I would rather be sloppy drunk
Sip-tin, in the can
You know I would rather be sloppy drunk, woman
Sip-tin, in the can
Now, then be out in the street, mm
Runnin' from the man

Because, a-oh-oh, mm
A-bring another half-a-pit 
Because, mm-mm-mm
Bring another half-a-pint
Now, an' I believe I'll get n' drunk
Baby, I'm gonna wreck this joint

Now, an' I love my moonshine whiskey
I tell thee world I do
Now, an' I love my moonshine whiskey
Tell thee the world I do
Now, but I drink some more whiskey
To get a-long with you

Now, an' I'm 'onna drink whiles I'm up, baby
Drink until I fall
Now, an' I'm gonna drink whiles I'm up, woman
Drink until I fall
Now, an if ya want me to stop drinkin' wh iskey
You ain't talkin' bout nothin' at all!
