Ohh
Lord thank you, thank you baby
Ohh
That's what I'm talking bout

Lovely as the summer time
Always been a friend of mine
Slicker than banana peels,cooler than three pair of high heels
You'll always be the highlight of my life...yeah
Love you like I love my fellas on the block
More valuable than coca-cola stock
Oh if I had my way this love will never stop
You're the only thing that matters oh since I lost my pops

More than a girl more than a friend
Some one I can depend on till the end
Most folks talk about me cause they don't see what we see
It's the difference between hating and loving me

Wonderful like a newborn babies smile
Amazing like being baptized in the Nile
Put me in impress me wine do that to me one more time
You will always be the highlight of my life
More alive than biggie and pac
Stronger than a pair of grandaddy's old socks
Oh if I had my way this love would never stop
Don't ever worry bout me leavin
Cause I'm satisfied with what I got

More than a girl more than a friend
Some one I can depend on till the end
Most folks talk about me cause they don't see what we see
It's the difference between hating and loving me

More than a girl, more than a girl, more than a girl you are my friend
Do that again, do that again, do that again, girl don't stop yet
Just wanna touch you to thank you to love you for everything that you givin
You will always be my girl and I will always be your man

More than a girl more than a friend
Some one I can depend on till the end
Most folks talk about me cause they don't see what we see
It's the difference between hating and loving me
