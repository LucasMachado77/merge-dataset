Satan lied to me, Satan lied to me
When he said he'd be my friend and all I'd ever need
Satan lied to me, Satan lied to me
He told me I was satisfied, Satan lied to me

Satan kept my soul astray, said I didn't need to pray
And he'd pat me on the back when I would agree
Told me I would lose my friends, that my fun in life would end
Now I'll tell you how I learned Satan lied to me

Satan lied to me, Satan lied to me
When he said he'd be my friend and all I'd ever need
Satan lied to me, Satan lied to me
He told me I was satisfied, Satan lied to me

I remember a little country church house where I'd planned to meet a friend one night to go on a party. I got there early and when it started to rain, I decided to wait inside. The service had started and when they would sing, pray, or preach, Satan kept saying "Now this is no place for you and the things they're saying are not true." Just when I was about to leave, the invitation was given as the preacher raised his hands and asked us all to stand and sing. And then I don't know how long I prayed, but when God raised me from that bench, I knew that Satan had lied to me.

Satan lied to me, Satan lied to me
When he said he'd be my friend and all I'd ever need
Satan lied to me, Satan lied to me
He told me I was satisfied, Satan lied to me
