Teenage girl, much too young
Unprepared for what's to come
A baby changes everything

Not a ring on her hand
All her dreams and all her plans
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything

The man she loves, she's never touched
How will she keep his trust?
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything

And she cries
Ooh, she cries

She has to leave, go far away
Heaven knows she can't stay
A baby changes everything

She can feel it's coming soon
There's no place, there's no room
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything

And she cries
And she cries
Ooh she cries

Shepherds all gather around
Up above a star shines down

Choir of angels say
Glory to the newborn king
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything
Everything, everything, every day
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

My whole life has turned around
I was lost but now I'm found
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything
