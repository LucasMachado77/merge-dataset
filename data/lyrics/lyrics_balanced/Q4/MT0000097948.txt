Once I had a gal
As sweet as she could be
Once I had a gal
And she was right for me
Kinda sandy hair
Eyes so soft and blue
That you couldn't help but care
When she looked at you
She called me "baby"...
"Baby", all the time

She said, "Baby, can't you see?
"Baby, understand
"Baby, you're for me
Won't you take my hand?"
But I pushed her away
Wouldn't let her near
Pushed her far away
Now I'm wishing I could hear her
Call me "Baby"...
"Baby", all the time

It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours
Without that gal I held so tight
Lord, I pray that You
Will listen to my plea
Keep her close to You
So she'll come back to me
And call me "Baby"...
"Baby", all the time

Baby...
Baby, all the time
