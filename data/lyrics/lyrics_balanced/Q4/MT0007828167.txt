When the music fades,
and all is striped away,
and I simply come,
longing just to bring
something that's of worth
that will bless Your heart.
I'll bring You more than a song
for a song in itself
is not what You have required.
You search much deeper within
through the way things appear.
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship,
and it's all about You it's all about You, Jesus.
I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it,
when it's all about You it's all about You, Jesus.

King of endless worth,
no one could express
how much You deserve.
Though I'm weak and I'm poor,
all I have is Yours,
every single breath.
I'll bring You more than a song
for a song in itself
is not what You have required.
You search much deeper within
through the way things appear.
You're looking into my heart.

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
and it's all about You it's all about You, Jesus.
I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it,
when it's all about You it's all about You, Jesus.

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
and it's all about You it's all about You, Jesus.
I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it,
when it's all about You it's all about You,
when it's all about You it's all about You, Jesus
