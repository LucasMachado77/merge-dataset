Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love

It was a late hot summer evening
First time I felt a breeze
She danced by me, pretty as she pleased
There's someone here, a friend said, I'd like for you to meet
And we two stepped the night away in the August eve

Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
She was dancing to the music
While I was falling in love

Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
She was only dancing
While I was falling in love

A memory of a lifetime
A passing in the dark
Love is so one-sided
So it seems

Today she may be somewhere
In someone else's arms
But tonight I know
She's dancing in my dreams

Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
She was dancing to the music
While I was falling in love

Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
She was only dancing
While I was falling in love

Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
