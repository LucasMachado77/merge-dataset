Them was going to Jerusalem
He met two strangers along the way
They were talking all about the Crucifixion
They stopped and here's what he said, he asked them

Were you there? Were you there when they cruci-, crucified the Lord?
(Were you there?)
He asked them, were you there when they crucified the Lord?
(Ooh, were you there)
Oh Lord

And one of them told him
Oh (Oh), sometimes (Sometimes) it causes me to tremble (Tremble)
Tremble (Tremble), tremble (Tremble)
He said I was there
Yes, I was there when they cruci-, crucified the Lord

A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there
Tell me, did they really, did they pierce Him in the side that morn
Oh Lord, he said if you were there
I wonder did they pierce, pierce the Savior in the side?
(Oh, were you there?)

Oh (Oh), sometimes (Sometimes) it causes me to tremble
Every time I think about how they did the Lord
It makes me tremble (Tremble) 'cause I was there
Yes, and they really, they really pierced him in the side that morning

A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
If you were there kindly tell me did he hang there
And never say one word now? Oh Lord
He said if you were there, I wonder did he hang there
And never say one word
The fellow looked at him, and then he said

Oh (Oh), sometimes (Sometimes) I have to tremble (Tremble)
Every time I think about how they done the Lord
It makes me tremble (Tremble)
Whoa-oh, oh, I was there when they cruci-, crucified the Lord
(Were you there?)
