I am the true vine
I am the true vine
I am the true vine
My father is a husbandman

I am
I am the true vine
I am
My father is a husbandman

One of these mornings, won't be long

My father is
You're gonna call me and I'll be gone
My father is a husbandman
One of these days 'bout twelve o'clock
My father is a husbandman
This old world is gonna reel and rock
My father is a husbandman
Gotta rest still and study yourself
My father is a husbandman
God's gonna move this ark himself
My father is a husbandman
One of these mornings bright and fair
My father is a husbandman
Gonna hitch on my wings and try the air
My father is a husbandman
I plan to tell you what a hypocrite will do
My father is a husbandman
He'll talk about me and talk about you
My father is a husbandman
I am the true vine
I am the true vine
I am the true vine
My father is a husbandman

I am
I am
Oh!
My father is

Well I want to go to heaven and I want to go right
My father is a husbandman
Want to go to heaven all dressed in white
My father is
Heaven so high and I'm so low
My father is
Don't know whether I'll get to heaven but I know
My father is a husbandman
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
My father is
Sometimes I'm almost level with the ground
My father is a husbandman

I am
Whoa!
Whoa!
My father is a husbandman
I am
I am
I am the true vine
Oooh!
