Everyday is just a day
To sing your praises
Everyday is just a day
To give you glory

So while the faithless fret
When destruction comes
Where they gonna run

Let Jah will be done
Just like the morning sun

Stop your war and stop your cruelness
This yah judgement a go really dread
And the wicked think them get away
But where they gonna run
Let Jah will be done
Just like the morning sun

I rise in the morning
And I'm thinking of love
For all Jah children
He created us
And all who don't hear the crying of the poor
Where them gonna run

Let Jah will be done
Just like the morning sun

Everyday is just a day
To sing your praises
Everyday is just a day
To give you glory

So while those faithless fret
When destruction come
Where they gonna run

Let Jah will be done, just like morning sun
Just like the evening sun
Just like the morning sun
Just like the evening sun
