Dancin' in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancin' in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzin' in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by, we're here, and gone

Lookin' for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark

What though love is old
What though song is old
Through them we can be young
Hear this heart of mine
Make yous part of mine
Dear one, tell me that we're one

Dancin' in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancin' in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzin' in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by, we're here, and gone t

Lookin' for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancin' in the dark
Dancin' in the dark
Dancin' in the dark
