A-true, a-true

Country boy
You're running up and down
Country boy
You go on like you know town
You no know bag-o-wire
You no know racecourse
You no know Pearl Harbor
Not even know light post

A-true, a-true
Everything I say
A-true, a-true
Everything I say

Country boy
And no-one knows your name
Country boy
Kingstonian get your blame
You no know Denham town
You no know Hunt's bay
You no know Parrish town
Boy get out of me weh

A-true, a-true
Everything I say
A-true, a-true
Everything I say

Country boy
You shootin' up the place
Country boy
You with your ratchet in your waist
You no know uptown
You no know downtown
You no know 'round town
Not even know Camperdown
