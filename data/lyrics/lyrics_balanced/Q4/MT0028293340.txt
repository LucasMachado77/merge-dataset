People are remarking on the change that's come over me
It can be explained very easily

Out of the blue, someone's come into my lonely world
And now I'm walking tall
And if even I can find someone
There's hope for us all

I had a reputation as a stay at home so and so
Cause when my friends would call me up
And say, "Let's hit a club"
I'd tell them no, no, no, no

I must admit there were times
When all I ever did was climb the walls
But if even I can find someone
There's hope for us all

If even I can find someone
There's hope for us all

Even in my darkest hour

There was still a light somewhere
Letting me know by its glow
That I'd find comfort there

I walked a lonely street
Waiting for love to come
And if even I can find someone
There's hope for us all

I must admit there were times
When all I ever did was climb the walls
But if even I, a feckless man
Who's thrown away every single chance he's ever had
Can find someone to check his fall
There must be hope for us all

If even I can find someone
There's hope for us all
