Like minutes are to an hour
Darling, so you are to me...

Maria Elena, you're the answer to a prayer
Maria Elena, can't you see how much I care?
To me your voice is like the echo of a sigh
And when you're near my heart can't speak above a sigh

Maria Elena, say that we will never part
Maria Elena, take me to your heart
A love like mine is great enough for two
To share this love is really all I ask of you

Maria Elena, say that we will never part
Maria Elena, take me to your heart
A love like mine is great enough for two
To share this love is really all I ask of you
