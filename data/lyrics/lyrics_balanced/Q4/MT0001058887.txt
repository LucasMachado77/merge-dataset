Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh (Ooh)

I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day, yeah
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
Oh, my girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well, well, well, I...

Well, I guess you'd say (I guess you'd say)
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey

I don't need no money
No fortune or fame, no no
I've got all the riches, baby
One man can claim
Oh, oh, oh, I

Well, I guess you'd say (I guess you'd say)
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, (You know it's my girl, now, now) my girl
I'm talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
Who's my girl, talkin' 'bout a sweet thing
Sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
On a cloudy day, baby, with my girl, my girl
It's all I can talk about
Oh baby, talkin' about my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout a pretty little sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
When it's cold outside, talkin' 'bout my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl
Everything, everything I say
I need my girl
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' 'bout my girl
I need my...talkin' 'bout my girl
I need my...
She's my girl
