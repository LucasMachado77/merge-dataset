There is a moment of surrender
Just before sleep comes
Just before sleep comes
I turn over my life's business
To the God of the Setting Sun
To the God of the Setting Sun
Sweet, sweet dreams
Sweet, sweet dreams

Of the day that's almost over
I hope my work is done
I hope my work is done
Whatever tomorrow brings
I can wait for dreams to come
I can wait for dreams to come
Sweet, sweet dreams
Sweet, sweet dreams

Just before sleep takes me
I pray for my loved ones
I pray for my loved ones
Sweet, sweet dreams
Sweet, sweet dreams...
