Let the kidees have the toys
The grown-ups make the noise
Give the neighbors all the presents
Under the tree

Give the snow and mistletoe
To the ones who love them so
But you'll be quite enough for me

When old Santa rides his sleigh
He can please me right away
With a present that forever will be new

Tell him my poor heart would sing
If one gift he'll only bring
For all I want for Christmas is you
Oh Santa rides his sleigh
He can please me right away
With a present that forever will be new
Tell him my poor heart would sing
If one gift he'll only bring
For all I want for Christmas is you
