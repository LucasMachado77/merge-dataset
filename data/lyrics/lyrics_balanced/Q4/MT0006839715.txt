I hear the calamity of young ideas gatherin' around the edge of my years, yeah
And we're waitin' for the bell to end the afternoon and usher in the evening, yeah...

I can hear them singin'... (The night is young, we've only just begun, yeah...)
I can hear them singing... (Grab a friend, jump on in, run from the end till it comes, yeah...)

The mirror has changed my shape - tomorrow used to be so kind and so far away, yeah
Now it's clear when I touch my face, the unmistakable feel of slippin' away, yeah...

I can hear them singin'... (The night is young, we've only just begun, yeah...)
I can hear them singing... (Grab a friend, jump on in, run from the end till it comes, yeah...)
My past is bigger and brighter than my future
But the struggle is all the same...
I fight to mean somethin' in this life I live
The end comes, but the work is undone...

Don't they know I'm still here
Pushin' against the atmosphere?
The best of things haven't been shared yet
It just can't be over yet... (over yet...)

Can they hear me screamin'? (The night is young, we've only just begun, yeah...)
Can they hear me screamin'? (Grab a friend, jump on in, run from the end till it comes, yeah...)
Hear me screamin'...

Riding away into the sun
Making way for the new horizon...
Riding away into the sun
Making way for the new horizon...
