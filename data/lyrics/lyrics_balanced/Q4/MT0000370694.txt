Put on the skillet
Slip on the lid
Mama's gonna make
A little shortnin' bread
That ain't all
She's gonna do
Mama's gonna make
A little coffee, too

Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Short'nin' bread
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread
Three little children
Lyin' in bed
Two were sick
And the other 'most dead
Sent for the doctor
And the doctor said
"Give those children some
Shortnin' bread."

Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread

When those children
Sick in bed
Heard that talk
About shortnin' bread
Popped up well
To dance and sing
Skipped around and cut
The pigeon wing

Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread

Slip to the kitchen
Slip up the led
Filled my pockets full of
Shortnin' bread
Stole the skillet
Stole the led
Stole the gal makin'
Shortnin' bread

Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread
Caught me with the skillet
Caught me with the led
Caught me with the gal makin'
Shortnin' bread
Paid six dollars for the skillet
Six dollars for the led
Spent six months in jail eatin'
Shortnin' bread

Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin', shortnin'
Mama's little baby loves
Shortnin' bread
