Sunny
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain

For the dark days are done
And the bright days are here
My sunny one shines... so sincere
Sunny one, so true...I love you

Sunny, sunny...
Thank you...for the sunshine bouquet
Su-unny...
Thank you for the love you brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel just about 10 feet tall
Sunny one, so true...I love you
Sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny
Thank you for the smile upon your face
Sunny, sunny
Thank you for that gleam that flows with grace

You're my spark of nature's fire
You are my sweet, complete desire
Sunny one, so true...I love you

Sunny one, so true...I love you
