Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you

Six months on the chain gang
Believe me, it is no fun, Lawd, Lawd

You're going to quit me, baby
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you

Jailhouse is no plaything
Believe me, is no lie, Lawd, Lawd

You're going to quit me, baby
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you
