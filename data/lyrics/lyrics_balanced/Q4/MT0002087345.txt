Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all and all

I was runnin' behind that train
Never could keep satisfied
The appetite for destruction
Keeps a man bound and tied

Shine your goodness down on me
Oh Lord - from up above
In my darkest hour
Soothe me with your tender love
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all and all

My Uncle Jolly used to tell me
Son don't waste your youth
Eyes blinded by fear and hatred
Will never ever see the truth

I keep prayin' I'll find wisdom
And the strength to carry on
Oh Lord, be my helper
Let they will in my life be done

Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all and all
