Mary Pickford used to eat roses
Thought that they'd make her beautiful and they did
One supposes

Douglas Fairbanks, he was so handsome
He wore a moustache
Must-a had much cash, too
Worth a king's ransom

Charlie Chaplin, he was invited
When these artists became united
When these artists became united

David Griffith worked as an extra
Then as a stagehand
Until they let him be
A director
Dave was brave, a mover and shaker
A true pioneer
He seemed to show no fear
A real film maker

Just like Chaplin, he was invited
When these artists became united
When these artists became united

They tied the knot together
Groom and bride couldn't hide their pleasure
They tried to pick fair weather
But love died, didn't last forever

Mary Pickford used to eat roses
Thought that they'd make her beautiful and they did
One supposes

Douglas Fairbanks, he was so handsome
He wore a moustache
Must-a had much cash too
Worth a king's ransom

Charlie Chaplin, he was invited
When these artists became united
When these artists became united
When these artists became united
