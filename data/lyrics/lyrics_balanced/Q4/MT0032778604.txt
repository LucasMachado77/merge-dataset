Oh baby girl
Mmm yeah
You are my angel
You are my angel

Sent from heaven above
From love
And I could love you love you
Girl, till the end of time

Your eyes
Are like a cat in the dark
That hypnotize every man
But I'm gonna watch you, watch you
Girl anywhere you go
Because I love you, love you
And I don't want to love you
No baby girl
Never never want to love you
Ooh my heart
Mmm, yeah
You gotta believe, me

Your eyes
Are like a cat in the dark
That hypnotize every man
But I'm gonna watch you, watch you
Girl anywhere you go
Because I love you, love you
And I don't want to love you

No, no, no, oh
Never want to love
Ooh never never never
Want to love you
