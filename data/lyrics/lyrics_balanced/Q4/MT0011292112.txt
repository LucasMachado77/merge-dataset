Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
Oh what fun it is to ride
Sing ( sing ) a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Come and ride with me
In that open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
I can't think of a better way
To spend the day
Then with you by my
You right by my side
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Come and ride with me
In that open sleigh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's you, it's me
The moon, the tree
Ride through the snow
With nowhere to go
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Come outside with me
Come and ride with me
In that open sleigh
Open sleigh
