Ah London you're a lady laid out before my eyes
Your golden heart is pulsing between your scarred-up thighs
Your eyes are full of sadness, red busses skirt your hem
Your headdress is a ring of lights, but I would not follow them

Your architects were madmen and your builders sane but drunk
But amidst your fading jewels shine acid house and punk
You are a scarlet lady, your streets run red with blood
My darling, they have used you and covered you with mud

It was deep down in your womb, my love, I drank my quart of sin
While Chinamen played cards and draughts and knocked back Mickey Finns
Your blood is like a river and its scent is beer and gin
Your hell is in the summer and you blossom in the spring

September is your purgatory, Christmas is your heaven
When the stinking streets of summer are washed away by rain
At the dark end of a lonely street, that's where you lose your pain
'Tis then your eyes dry up, my love, and sparkle once again
