Words and music are all that I need
I will follow wherever they lead
And I'm finding more fun in the game
A darling boy has brought me joy, sweet Georgie Fame

Oh, I heard him one night quite by chance
Now wherever I'm walking, I dance
And London is not quite the same
'cause when he sings, the city swings, sweet Georgie Fame

London Bridge is falling down
Pop songs I hear with suspicion
But now at last I'm glad to meet a sweet lovin' real good musician

Oh, from Broadway to Festival Hall
I have listened and I've heard them all
And they say I'm a real swinging dame
Yet I'm impressed, my ears are blessed with Georgie Fame

London Bridge is falling down
Pop songs I hear with suspicion
But now at last I'm glad to meet a sweet lovin' real good musician

Oh, from Broadway to Festival Hall
I have listened and I've heard them all
And they say I'm a real swinging dame
Yet I'm impressed, my ears are blessed with Georgie Fame

So stay a while, you'll see 'em smile, you won't complain
His hands and feet make music sweet, you'll miss your train
My goose is cooked, l'm gettin' hooked
On Georgie Fame!!!
