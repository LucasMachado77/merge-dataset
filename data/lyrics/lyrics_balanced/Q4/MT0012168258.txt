The evening breeze caressed the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze, tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

The shore was kissed by sea and mist, tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly
The evening breeze erased the trees, tenderly

The trembling trees embraced the breeze, tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

Oh, the shores were kissed by the mist, tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met, tenderly
Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my chops away from pops, tenderly

Oh tenderly
Tenderly
Oh, oh
