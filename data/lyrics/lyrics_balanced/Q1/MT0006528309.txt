I've got love on my mind
I've got sweet loving on my mind
No matter how hard I try to pass my time
I always wind up with you on my mind
Imagine us checking each other out
Trying to find out what love is all about
While others take love simply for what it's worth
I think we can find heaven here on Earth

You're all I need
To make this dream come true
It's sweet music, soft lights and you
Can you imagine what we could do
With sweet music, soft lights and you

Baby

My mind paints a picture
Of a beautiful love affair
Me coming home and find you waiting there
I can't see you with anybody else
But then again I might be jiving myself
I gotta stop this dreaming make this thing for real
I gotta face reality and show you how I feel
I've seen so much of you I've become attached
And wanting you is like an itch that I can't scratch

Baby

You're all I need
To make this dream come true
It's sweet music, soft lights and you
Can you imagine what we could do
With sweet music, soft lights and you

Soft lights, sweet music and you
I like that sweet music so turn it up
Baby I'm in the moon in the mood

You're all I need
To make this dream come true
It's sweet music, soft lights and you
Can you imagine what we could do
With sweet music, soft lights and you

You're all I need
To make this dream come true
It's sweet music, soft lights and you
Can you imagine what we could do
With sweet music, soft lights and you

You're all I need
To make this dream come true
It's sweet music, soft lights and you
Can you imagine what we could do
With sweet music, soft lights and you

You know I'm telling my dreams here
You don't have no dreams now
It is fulfilled daydreams
Lord, have mercy fulfil me, fulfil me.
