When this old world has let you down
And friends no longer want you around
When you feel burdened down with care
And troubles seem so hard to bear

Call my name
Hear me talkin' to ya baby
Call my name
Don't ya hear what I'm sayin'?
Call my name
A-whoa-oh-oh-oh
(call my name)
And i'll be there

If ya feel that you're all alone
And sick inside away from home
When you no longer want to try
Or care if you should live or die
Call my name
Hear me talkin' to ya baby
Call my name
Don't ya hear what I'm sayin'?
Call my name
A whoa-woah-oh-oh
(call my name) yeah
An i'll be there

Yeah

When evra'thing that you try has failed
And you never even get no mail
Well life to you seems such a bore
And blues come callin' 'round your door

Call my name
Hear me talkin' to ya baby
(call my name)
Call my name
Don't you hear what I'm sayin'?
Call my name
Any time ya need me (call my name)
Anytime ya want me baby
All ya gotta do is (call my name) call me
Fades
All ya gotta do is (call my name) call me
An I be right there
