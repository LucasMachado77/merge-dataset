It could all be so simple, simple

Don't need high heels for a good feel
You can keep the fancy clothes
I'll take walkin' in the rain
Over things material
I'll trade Melrose and the big names
Give me faces that I know
Just play a melody that everybody knows

Take it down, down, down
And strip it to the core
I don't really need much less is more, more, more

True to life, true to me
The way it's got to be
So simple, so simple, so simple
Live to love, love to be
Absolutely free
(So simple, so simple, simple)

Give me wisdom, plain and truthful
Teach me somethin I don't know
Plain as education, inspiration I suppose (Yeah yeah)
Give me family, on a Sunday
And I'll be just fine
There's nothing in the world
That's worth more of my time

Take it down, down, down
And strip it to the core
I don't really need much less is more, more, more

True to life, true to me
The way it's got to be
So simple, so simple, so simple
Live to love, love to be
Absolutely free (So simple, so simple, simple)
True to life, true to me
The way it's got to be
So simple, so simple, so simple
Live to love, love to be
Absolutely free
(So simple, so simple, simple)

Livin my dream, is my song to the world (Let 'em hear it)
Sharin' my soul and spirit
I'm hopin that you hear it
Got one (One) life (Life) to live (Live)
It's only what you make it (Make it)
Every new day's a chance worth takin

True to life, true to me
The way it's got to be
So simple, so simple, so simple
Live to love, love to be
Absolutely free (So simple, so simple, simple)
True to life, true to me
The way it's got to be
So simple, so simple, so simple
Live to love, love to be
Absolutely free (So simple, so simple, simple)
