Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

Same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm a flame
Flame, burning desire
That only your kiss
Put out the fire
For your the lover that I've waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Ooh in a spin, lovin the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, lovin the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm a flame
Flame, burning desire
That only your kiss
Put out the fire

For your the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for
And everytime your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Ah, in a spin, lovin the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, lovin the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
Under the old black magic called love!
