Walkin' with my baby, she's got great big feet
She long lean and lanky and ain't had nothin' to eat!
But she's my baby and I love her just the same
Crazy about that woman 'cause Caldonia is her name
Caldonia!
Caldonia!
What makes your big head so hard? Huh!
I love you, love you just the same
I'll always love you baby 'cause Caldonia is your name
You know

That's what she told me, no kiddin'!
That's what she said!
She says
"Son, keep away from that woman,she ain't no good, don't bother with her!"
But momma didn't know what Caldonia was puttin' down!
So I'm goin' down to Caldonia's house, and ask her just one more time!
Caldonia!
Caldonia!
What makes your big head so hard?
Now!
