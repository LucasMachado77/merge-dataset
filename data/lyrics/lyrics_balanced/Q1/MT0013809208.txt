I've been a girl with her skirt pulled high
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes
I see the world
As a candy store

With a cigarette smile saying things you can't ignore
Like, mommy I love you
Daddy I hate you
Brother I need you

Love or hate, fuck you, I can see everything
Here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

I've been a girl with her finger in the air Unaffected by rumors the truth I don't care
So open your mouth, stick out your tongue
Might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done
Just find a new life style,reason to smile

Look for nirvana, under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex strings
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

Take what you get and get what you give
I said don't run from yourself,man, that's no way to live( no, no)
I've got a record in my bag,you should give it a spin
Put your hands in the air so that life can begin

(If God is a D.J, if God, say if God is a dj, if God...then life is a dance floor)
Get your ass on the dance floor now!

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it
