The way you walk and the way you smile
I guess that's the thing that drives me wild, oh
The way you hug and the way you love
Girl, you're the only one I'm thinking of, baby

'Cause you got that special way of loving me, yeah
And keeping me satisfied, no, no, no, no
Girl, you know how to do that thing to me
And I always want you there laying by my side

no matter what they say about it
(All the little things that you do) they can't tell me about it, no they can't
(Keep on lovin' you)
(All the little things that you do) yeah

The way you kiss and the way you twist
If you're gone for a minute
I swear that's the thing I miss, yeah
The way you swerve and the way you curve
Girl, that's the thing that wrecks my nerves, baby

'Cause you got that special way of loving me, yeah
That keeping me satisfied, no, no, girl
Girl, you know how to do that thing to me
And I always want you there laying by my side

hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
(All the little things that you do) it don't matter
(Keep on lovin' you) and all the little things
(All the little things that you do)
You do (lord)

'Cause you got that special way of loving me
That keeps me so satisfied, no
And you know how to do that thing to me
And I always want you there laying by my side

Hey-hey, hey-hey, yeah (all the little things that you do)
It don't matter what you do (keep on lovin' you)
I'm gonna keep on lovin' you (all the little things that you do)

I'm gonna (keep on lovin' you) keep on love
Gonna keep on lovin' you, girl, yeah (all the little things that you do)
You can, you can walk on me (keep on lovin' you)
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you (all the little things that you do)
They can scandalize my name (keep on lovin' you)
But I'm gonna love just the same, babe (all the little things that you do)
You can, you can do anything (keep on lovin' you)
Anything you wanna (all the little things that you do)

'Cause I, I'm gonna (keep on lovin' you)
And all the little things that you do, babe (all the little things that you do)
You see, you can, you can sleep late (keep on lovin' you)
And I'm still gonna keep everything I have (all the little things that you do)
You see, I know what you mean to me
