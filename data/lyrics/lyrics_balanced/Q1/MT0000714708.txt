Hey, Mr. DJ put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby

Do you like to boogie-woogie, do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie, do you like my acid rock??

Hey Mr. DJ put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music, music
Music makes the people come together
Music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Don't think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie
It's like ridin' on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it every day

Music makes the people come together
Music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Hey Mr. DJ

Do you like to boogie-woogie

Do you like my acid rock?
