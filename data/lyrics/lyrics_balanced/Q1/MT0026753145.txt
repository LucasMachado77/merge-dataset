Hit me!

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh'
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh')

Ooh, I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now, you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I had done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast, baby now I can't find you
Ooh, I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk, but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh'
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh')

Ooh, two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partner that meets me only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep where you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Do, you understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you?
You're movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference from a man and a adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to steppin'

Can you keep up? (ooh)
Baby boy, make me lose my breath (my breath)
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh' (ha ha)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh') (ooh-ooh)

Can you keep up? (ooh)
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath (my breath)
Hit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh' (ha ha)
Can you keep up? (can you keep up, yeah?)
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh') (ooh)

If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this drum
Why you asked for something?
You ain't really want not'in'
If you can't make me say 'ooh'
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby
You are dismissed

Come on
Breathe with me
'Huh, huh'
Darkchild
Come on, let's go

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh'
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh')

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh'
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh')
