It's two past midnight the heat is on
You keep on tellin' Babe I'm the one
I've been mistreated always coming back for more
Stranger in paradise but stronger than before
Than before, oh yeah

So red is your color
Red as your lips
Heaven or hell, Babe your fingertips
The temperature's rising out of control
'Cause of your hungry eyes feel them in my soul

Don't need nobody
You know what's wrong 'n right
Yes, you've told me many times
No guardian angel right behind your back
When you slide into the night

So get it while you can Babe or you won't be satisfied
You're the kinda lady come n' join me for a ride
So get it while you can Babe there's no hope for charity
You're my pretty Baby take a chance on me

Sweet little angel, lend me your hand
Ain't gonna take too long, you'll understand
See, I've been waiting for a long long time
Now that I've found you girl I'll make you mine

Don't need nobody
You know what's wrong 'n right
Yes, you've told me many times
No guardian angel right behind your back
When you slide into the night

So get it while you can Babe or you won't be satisfied
You're the kinda lady come n' join me for a ride
So get it while you can Babe there's no hope for charity
You're my pretty Baby take a chance on me

You're the kinda lady
Come n' join me for a ride
Oh, you're my pretty Baby
