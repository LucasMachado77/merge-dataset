I don't want to think about it, why can't I live without it?
Oh, I need the love
I'm free and independent, I just take life and I spend it
Oh, I need the love
I'll feel the flames of a million fires
Fed by my feelings and my desires
Oh, I need the love
Oh, I want the love
I just need the power from above
I just got the power from above

Can't believe I saw the light, never thought I'd see the day
So filled with wrong I couldn't see right, almost lost the way
I was headed down, taken by the tide
I was lost at sea, missing in action, taken for a ride

Now I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power from above
I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power, power of love

All the time I knew what was wrong, but denied it all the same
I was so blind I sang the same song, thought it was a game
But when I looked inside, the writing on the wall
Said, "it's a long way down, face it clown, fool you're gonna fall"

Now I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power from above
I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power, power of love

That's right

Now I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power from above
I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power, power of love

Power of love
Power of love
