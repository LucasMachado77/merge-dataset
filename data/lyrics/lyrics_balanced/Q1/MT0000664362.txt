Hello, Dolly, well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're looking swell, Dolly
We can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
We feel the room swayin
For the band's playin
One of your old fav rite songs from way back when
So, take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

So, golly gee, fellas
Find her a vacant knee, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again
