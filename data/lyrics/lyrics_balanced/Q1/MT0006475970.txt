Hangin' in the VIP
Saw him comin' to holla at me a
Playboy pique my curiosity when
He asked me if I wanted to trade
I was on my second drink and
Feelin' sexy, now what is he thinkin'?
Bangin', dancin', which way is he swingin'?
What did he want from me?

Oh I
Aint' got no hang-ups
Oh I
Come to have fun tonight
Oh I
Might want to check him out
Oh I
As long as he can swing it my way
Oh I
Like is confidence
Oh I
So busy talklin' hit
Oh I
Hope he can handle this
Let's take it to the floor, spend the whole night
Swingin'

Be bop be bop be bop be ba
If you like swingin' get your hands up
Be bop be bop be bop be ba
If you like swingin get your hands up
Be bop be bop be bop be ba
If you like swingin' get your hands up
Be bop be bop be bop be ba
If you like swingin' get your hands up

Fingers poppin' still boppin'
We get tired but ain't no stoppin'
Come on with it sweat keeps droppin'
Rollin' off the side of my face
Dirty dancin' huggin' kissin'
All the fun I woulda been missin'
Didn't know he had it like this and
It's so good I want some more

Oh I
Aint' got no hang-ups
Oh I
Come to have fun tonight
Oh I
Might want to check him out
Oh I
As long as he can swing it my way
Oh I
Like is confidence
Oh I
So busy talklin' hit
Oh I
Hope he can handle this
Let's take it to the floor, spend the whole night
Swingin'

Don't need a tired cliche
If you wanna make a move my way
So keep them less restrained its about what you do
Not what you say
Cat daddy's obsessed
Tryin' to get under my dress
But I'm not imnpressed
Baby bou is dreamin' less he's plannin' on swingin'
