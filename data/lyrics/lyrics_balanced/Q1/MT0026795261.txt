I got a good leg woman, she's alright with me
I got a good leg woman yeah, she's alright with me
She's a hip shakin' mama and she suits me, suits me to a Tee now
I never wanted for nothing
She bought me everything I needed
The good thing about her
She treats me like I wanna be treated
She's got a hip shakin' mama and she suits me, suits me to a Tee now

My baby she's so fine
She makes a blind man see
She's mine o mine yeah
Belongs to no one but me
She's got a hip shakin' mama and she suits me, suits me to a Tee now

Wow, tellin' about my baby
Nobody but my baby
She belongs to no one but me
And she's mine o mine

And I'm talkin' about my good babe
I'm talkin' about my gorgeous little girl
And she's alright now
Come say it she's all..., she's alright now
And she's something
Oh, she's something else
