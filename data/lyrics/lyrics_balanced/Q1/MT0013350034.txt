I'm steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight

Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

There'll be smooth sailin'
'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With my top hat
And my white tie and my tails

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will that day be
The big day may be tonight

If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love

You don't have to ask me
I won't waste your time
But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime, dance
There'll be smooth sailin'
'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails
In my top hat
And my white tie and my tails

I'm steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will that day be
The big day may be tonight, what a night
