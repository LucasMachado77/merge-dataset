In the land of make believe you are all mine
In the land of make believe I'm doin' fine
Makin' believe you are here with me, makin' believe

In the grass by my mind's flowing river
Tumblin' of the waters through my head
Makin' believe, you are here with me, making believe, making believe

I hear bells and children playin'
I see love and birds are singin'

In the land of make believe you are all mine
In the land of make believe I'm doin' fine
Makin' believe you are here with me
Makin' believe
Here, you and me make believe
Make believe the world isn't what we see

Hey, things ain't what they seem
Come into my dream
Make believe with me

Here, you and me make believe
Make believe the world isn't what we see

Hey, things ain't what they seem
Come into my dream
Make believe with me

La, la la la la la la...
