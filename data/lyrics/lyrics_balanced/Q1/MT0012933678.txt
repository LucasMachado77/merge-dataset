Something's got control of me feels like I'm in a trance
Electricity runs through me dnd makes me want to dance
Take me in your arms, cause I'm want to dance all night with you
When you move I feel your magic running through me
And I grow helpless as we dance the night away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, dance

Dance, dance I can't control it
You're making me really want it
The way you move to the rhythm
Is taking over me, you
Dance, dance and I want you badly
I'm in a trance come and have me
Cause I can't stop going crazy
Just satisfy me baby, dance

Hypnotizing rhythms make me move at your command
I can be your slave and dance all night if you demand
You make me lose my mind and I can't take it any longer
I feel the power that you have is getting stronger
Baby, let's dance the whole night away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, dance

Oh, oh you tightly control, every part of me
Don't you know you're a kind of fire sending to me
Dance, dance
