Open the door, dear
I must get in your heart!
You're making it hard
To be true

So please, come open the door, dear
And then, perhaps, you'll find
You've had me on your mind

No matter
How you tried to avoid me
You can't get away so easy
If you will not come to me I'll come
To you
Open the door, please
Why make me beg and beg?
Why torture me
Like this?

Can't you see
I've got love
Plenty love to give you
I've got love
Lots of
Love to give to you

I've got love
