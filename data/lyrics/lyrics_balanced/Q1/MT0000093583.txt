Conversation is going 'round
People talking 'bout the girl who's come to town
Lovely lady pretty as can be
No one knows her name she's just a mystery
I have seen her maybe once or twice
The one thing I can say thought she's very nice
She's a lady one I really want to know
Somehow I've got to let my feeling show

She's fresh exciting

I've been thinking about the way you walk
Baby I like the way you talk
Tell you something I really can't hide
Heaven must have sent you to be by my side
Fresh and lovely like a dream come true
I'll give anything to spend the night with you
What a feeling and I can't stop it baby
Miss frisky lady take me away

She's fresh as a summer breeze
She'll take you by surprise
She means so much to me
I'll do whatever to make her mine baby

She's fresh she's so fresh 

Fresh as a summer breeze

And pray she'll understand
'Cause I love the way she walks
And ooh baby I love the way she talks
