Walk with my baby, she got great big feet
She long, lean and lanky and had nothin' to eat
But she's my baby and I love her, just the same

Yeah I'm crazy 'bout this woman cause Caldonia is her name

Caldonia!

What makes your big head so hard? Hey!

I love you just the same
Crazy 'bout you baby because Caldonia is your name

Caldonia!
Caldonia!
What makes your big head so hard? Hey!

Caldonia!
Caldonia!
What makes your big head so hard? Hey!

Ahh, Caldonia

What makes your big head so hard?
