Well, well, well
Just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're hot
Just because you think you've got something
That nobody has got

Well, you know you made me spend all my money, honey
You laughed and you called me old Santa Claus
Ooh, I'm telling you baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because

Well, just because you think I'll be lonesome
And just because you think that I'll be blue
Just because you think I'll be foolish
I'll stand around, wait around for you

And though you made me drop all my girlfriends
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Ooh, I'm telling you baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because
Come on, boys

Well, there will come a time when you'll be lonesome
And there will come a time when you'll be blue
There'll come a time when ol' Santa
Hey, he won't pay the bills for you

Ooh just because you think I'll be foolish
Honey, you laughed and called me old Santa Claus
I'm telling you baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because
Aw, come on

Well, just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in town
Well just because you think you've got something
Ooh that nobody has got

Well, you know you made me spend all my money, honey
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you, baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because, yeah
Because, well well, just because, mmm mmm
Because, well well, just because
