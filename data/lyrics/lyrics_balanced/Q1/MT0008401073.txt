Well I'm going down to Austin, Texas
I'm going down to save my soul
Get that barbeque and chili
Eat my fill then come back home
I'm gonna take my baby with me
We gonna have a high old time
We gonna eat till we get silly
Sure do make a beer taste fine

Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' something?
Oh momma, it'll stop your belly and backbone bumpin'
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' good?
Oh momma, eat it everyday if I could

Well, I know a man that cook armadillo
Tastes so sweet, he called it pie
I know a woman makes pan dulce
Tastes so good, it gets you high
Get them enchiladas greasy
Get them steaks chicken-fried
Sure do make a man feel happy
To see white gravy on the side

Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' something?
Oh momma, it'll stop your belly and backbone bumpin'
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' good?
Oh momma, eat it everyday if I could

I know a place that got fried okra
Beat anything I ever saw
I know a man that cook cabrito
It must be against the law
We gonna get a big old sausage
A big old plate of ranch-style beans
I could eat the heart of Texas
We gonna need some brand new jeans

Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' something?
Oh momma, it'll stop your belly and backbone bumpin'
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' good?
Oh momma, eat it everyday if I could, yeah

Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' something?
Oh momma, it'll stop your belly and backbone bumpin'
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' good?
Oh momma, eat it everyday if I could, say
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' something?
Oh momma, it'll stop your belly and backbone bumpin'
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' good?
Oh momma, eat it everyday if I could, yeah

Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' something?
Oh momma, it'll stop your belly and backbone bumpin'
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' good?
Oh momma, eat it everyday if I could
Oh momma, ain't that Texas cookin' something?
