Turn off the lights and light a candle
Tonight I'm in a romantic mood, yeah

Let's take a shower, shower together, yeah
I'll wash your body and you'll wash mine, yeah
Rub me down in some hot oils, baby, yeah
And I'll do the same thing to you

Just turn off the lights, come to me
Girl, I want to give you a special treat, you're so sweet
Turn off the lights and let's get cozy
See, you're the only one in the world that I need

I want to love you, love you all over, yeah
Over and over and over and over and over
And over and over and over again
Whisper sweet words of love in your ear
Show you I much I missed you, missed you, my dear

Turn 'em off and come to me
Tonight, I'm in a sexy mood, baby
And light a candle
Girl, there's something that I-I want to do to you,
I want to do, I want to do to you, baby

Would you mind if I asked you to
Would you rub me down
Would you rub me down in some, in some burnin' hot oils, baby, yeah
I swear I can do the same thing, the same thing to you, baby

Turn 'em off and let's get cozy
I want to give you a special treat, you've been so sweet
Turn 'em off and come closer
You're the only one in this whole wide world that I'd ever need

Turn 'em off and light a candle
You see, there's somethin' I, somethin' I,
Somethin' I, somethin' I
Somethin' I want to do to you, baby

I'm lyin' here waitin', my dear
You can get what you want any time you want it
I'm lyin' here waitin', my dear
Come get what you need, give me what I need

Tell me what you want to do (There's somethin' I)
Tell me what you want to do, babe
(There's somethin' I, somethin' I want to do to you, baby)
Tell me what you want to do (Yeah)
Tell me what you want to do, babe (Yes)

Tell me what you want to do (I've got somethin' in my mind)
Tell me what you want to do, babe

Tell me what you want to do (I want to give you a special treat)
Tell me what you want to do, babe ('Cause you've been so sweet, yeah, yes)

Tell me what you want to do (I can do it)
Tell me what you want to do, babe (I'm willin')
