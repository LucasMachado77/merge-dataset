Everyone's thinking they're so hot tonight
But there's a fire in your eyes
Everybody wants you girl
But I want you more than any other guy
You got what I want, I got what you need, fire below
So if you know it, show it, don't let me go, whooah
Turn on the night - I can't wait, can't wait any longer
Turn on the night - yeah
I want to feel this feeling get stronger
Take me in your arms, I'll take you into my heart
Let's bring this love to life
Come on baby put your finger on the switch
Let's make some sparks ignite
Show me what you want, show me what you need, fire below
Come on and take me, shake me, don't let me go, whooah
